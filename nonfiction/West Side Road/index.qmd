Dear —, 

The other day I drove West on the way back instead of East Side Road, which has to mean something worth writing about.

The other day, Dad warned us. 

"Don't end a sentence in a preposition." 

What would she think, how would she feel, Grandma who was an English teacher?

[insert more]

We're in the Italian market next to the Italian restaurant, next to the Gun Club. I've never seen proof, but I know somehow. The kitchens connect, and you can order at the bar. 

Mom spots a little bottle of chili oil, like the ones on the tables in the tall glasses nextdoor. It's just chili oil. Still, something about Diavola's is different. 

"We can bring this to ____. Carry it in our purse!"

We like to drown the crust.

"Ooo!"

My eyes are on the chicken cutlet, and I don't know what the two of them are talking about. 

"What is it?"

My sister hands it to me.

"Careful," she says. "It's oily."

I've been holding the inheritance for no more than a few seconds, and already I've exercised no care.

"Should I oil the ends of my?"

She looks at my hair, a curly mess. The air always has a way of taking the moisture out.

"Ew, don't."

Love,

Elizabeth Kolling
