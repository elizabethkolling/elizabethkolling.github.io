Dear —, 

High street always leads to Fulton, and I had had my fill.

“Boring Hill,” said a Rohan (not Rowan) of London outside Public Records afterwards.

I had had hours to kill earlier, emerging from the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station. I follow my passion in the ways I can. Sometimes that means an A train after work, 45 minutes downtown and east to somewhere unbeknown (to me) in Brooklyn. The literary networking event wasn’t starting until 8, it was still before six, and I had at least an hour and a half before I was to meet my new acquaintance who can also be found tapping at the keys at McNally Jackson.

“Are you a writer?” I had asked a number of weeks ago.

“Yes…” 

A literary connection! I gave the MFA student my email, and he insisted that he’d send some of what he’s written. I never promised to do the same (too personal). I’ve never liked sharing what I’m writing. I have an ego when it comes to my ideas. They’re pure genius, and other writers are vultures (I’m being facetious but there is some truth to this feeling). Plus, they are works in progress and some of my writing is bad writing. Any way, this was weeks before a very special person with a PhD helped me code a website for my writing.  He asked what icon and color scheme I wanted. I liked the lone rose with a tall stem and sparse leaves, and I like the color pink (because, well, I’m just a girl at the end of the day). Any way, weeks later, the MFA student had invited me to a literary event. 

“My friend can’t go, and I have an extra ticket,” he had said (dialogue is not verbatim). “It’ll be good for networking.”

His professors and peers would be there. That sounded good to me, as someone on the outside. 

“There’s this biweekly writer’s group I go to (I’ve been once), and one is on Wednesday, but send me the info and I’ll let you know.”

“Okay, but let me know, or I’ll ask someone else.”

In everything there is opportunity cost. I’ve never been a networker (it’s icky and weird to me to pursue a connection with some ulterior, self-aggrandizing motive or to some aim, and asking for a job doesn’t scream merit-based to me. Leeching off of other people isn’t any way to make it in this world, at least for me. Then again, maybe I just don’t know how to ask for what I want). I want community, and friends with similar interests. I’ve never taken a creative writing class. I know no professors who may be able to write me a recommendation (I do know a film professor who is a little stuck up and has recommended that I not apply to fellowships before (I applied any way, and didn’t get in)), and for every application it seems you need at least two or three. So, the opinion of others does matter and maybe networking is just meeting people. I do like meeting people, and I think I’m good at it (I learned that from someone). The more the merrier. 

I don’t like committing to things, but I ultimately decided to give up going to the writer’s group and instead go to the literary event. Who knows, maybe a book deal would come of it. 

So, there I was, walking south down Bond Street, unknowingly in the direction of Cafe Kitsumé. It looked like a nice place to sit and read for the next hour or so, so I approached the door. This is when I saw the hours posted. Closing time was six, so that left me 16 minutes of potential bliss. Not worth it. I pulled up Maps and searched cafes. I saw I was in a place called Boerum Hill, which is where my friend Mia lives. I hold her dear, and I wonder what Mia’s up to. I almost sent a text, but I didn’t. Cafes was not the search, so I searched coffee shops. Perfect. There was one nearby that closed at seven (allegedly). That would give me a good, dedicated hour to reading. I started walking to it, and an employee was collapsing chairs outside. It was 5:57 pm and the space was empty. 

“Are you still open?”

“Uh, no, we’re closing, we close at six, but we could make you a drink to go.”

I don't care for coffee or expensive iced teas. I'm interested in third spaces for the sake of them, to sit and read or write in a place with good feng shui. I said, “Oh, that’s okay, thank you,” and loitered outside a Cuban restaurant to think. I stood there thinking until I turned around and started walking the way I came. One facade did catch my eye, and I peeled off to read the menu. Mediterranean. No whalers. There was a burger (a few) on the menu, and an old woman bent at a 90-degree angle pushed the door open. 

I read the Chowder chapter and asked for a burger (medium-rare)

"It comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion, would you like to add blue cheese or cheddar cheese or goat cheese or bacon?"

"Ooo, could I hold the tomato and hmmmm, I usually go blue, but goat cheese sounds good."

"Goat cheese is my go-to."

"Let's do goat cheese."

"You got it."

I asked for the check and walked to the top of the block to meet the MFA student. At Grand Army, I didn't order a drink. The man behind the bar had on a white t-shirt with a Krabby Patty and Spongebog, and square pants. Tattoos were on his arms, which were long enough to reach over the counter to the edge of the bar, where my tall glass of water was nearing empty. 

“Nice reach!” I said.

“Thanks,” he said and turned to fill another’s. 

“Square sponge Bob,” I remembered a wise woman say once, and I was thinking of —

Ultimately, I felt a little duped. It wasn’t a literary event for networking as it had been represented to me, not really. It was kind of like going to the club, loud, dark, with people holding cocktails in their hands, which I couldn’t care less about. I started talking to someone who worked in marketing for a B2B software company. 

“Stripe?” I asked.

“No,” he said. “Have you heard of Rippling?”

“Yes! I see their ads everywhere. So, that’s you.”

“That’s me, I guess.”

This man was the plus one of the man next to him who had just slipped away to the bar. He introduced his boyfriend as a self-proclaimed poet.

“So cool,” I said.

The poet came back with a sparkling Yerba mate, and the MFA student made his way over. We cheersed (I with my pantomimed hand around an imaginary beverage) and all talked for a bit and then released one another to the rest of the room. The MFA student told me he saw none of his professors and none of his fellow MFAs. That made complete sense to me, and the reality of the evening was sinking in.

“So have you found your community?" 

“Me?” 

“Yeah,” the self-proclaimed poet said to me. I had been spacing out. Other things were on my mind, per usual. 

"I don't know," I said. "Maybe, I mean, writing has always been a very solitary activity for me. It still is."  

The event was at Public Records, where I’d been once before, on April 1, 2023 (Fools’ day), which has left an indelible mark on me and also not even close to one at the same time. 

I was ready to leave, so I cut loose after a conversation with a writer based in Red Hook that I could only half-hear came to a natural end. The MFA student saw someone he knew, and he b-lined it for her. This was a blessing (no offense) my opportunity to save my ears and get the heck out of there. So, I did just that, having been there for at most a half hour. I made my mad dash out of the place. As I was reaching the point of my departure where I started to think less about leaving and more about walking to the station, I looked up to see that Mia was walking towards me. 

"Ah!" we both exclaimed, surprised and happy to see each other.

She was on her way to the event herself just as I was on my out. A miracle, and another gift from the universe. A guy named I'd learn was from London and named Rohan with an H instead of a W walked up to her and she greeted him. Any way, a woman or man was knelt on the pavement in a sea of cans, sorting, as we spoke and she introduced us.

"Oh, a high school friend," Rohan said, maybe impressed.

(We go way back)

"How was it?" Mia asked.

"Super loud," I said. "So wear your earplugs." 

Sometimes you go to something, because someone invited you. It's hit or miss, and maybe there's a miracle to be had. My favorite moment from today was running into Mia out in the wild. Also reading the chowder chapter at a restaurant bar. I couldn’t cop a cafe, but I could a Bajin burger. It wasn’t the best burger but it was good enough with the goat cheese. The fries were thin and shriveled, dry and slightly hollow on the inside (reminded me of In N Out), nothing to write home about. 



Love,
