Dear —, 

High street always leads to Fulton, and I had had my fill (I couldn’t cop a cafe, but I could a Bajin burger). 

I had had hours to kill earlier, emerging from the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station. I follow my passion in the ways I can. Sometimes that means an A train after work, 45 minutes downtown and east to somewhere unbeknown (to me) in Brooklyn. The literary networking event wasn’t starting until 8, it was still before six, and I had at least an hour and a half before I was to meet my new acquaintance who can also be found tapping at the keys at McNally Jackson.

“Are you a writer?” I had asked a number of weeks ago.

“Yes…” 

A literary connection! I gave the MFA student my email, and he insisted that he’d send some of what he’s written. I never promised to do the same (too personal). I’ve never liked sharing what I’m writing. I have an ego when it comes to my ideas. They’re pure genius, and other writers are vultures (I’m being facetious but there is some truth to this feeling). Plus, they are works in progress and some of my writing is bad writing. Any way, this was weeks before a very special person with a PhD helped me code a website for my writing.  He asked what icon and color scheme I wanted. I liked the lone rose with a tall stem and sparse leaves, and I like the color pink (because, well, I’m just a girl at the end of the day). Any way, weeks later, the MFA student had invited me to a literary event. 

“My friend can’t go, and I have an extra ticket,” he had said (dialogue is not verbatim). “It’ll be good for networking.”

His professors and peers would be there. That sounded good to me, as someone on the outside. 

“There’s this biweekly writer’s group I go to (I’ve been once), and one is on Wednesday, but send me the info and I’ll let you know.”

“Okay, but let me know, or I’ll ask someone else.”


Love, 

Elizabeth Kolling
