Dear â€”, 

[insert more]

The Lion of God has a break.

He sits across from me, and sets his timer to sixteen minutes.

The countdown has started as I look up from my page and smile. 

"You read a lot."

I don't know about a lot. 

Every time walking into a bookstore is an exercise in humility.

There is always more to read. 

There is actually very little I have read.

"Can I take this in for you?"

I look down at the cup and saucer, up at him.

It's a very kind offer.

Yes, I say, thank you.

"See you tomorrow."
 
I don't have faith in Monday.

"Or when will I next see you?"

I wasn't sure, Thursday, Friday, or same time Sunday. 

Love, 

Elizabeth Kolling
