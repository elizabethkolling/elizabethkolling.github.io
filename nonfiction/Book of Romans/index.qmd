Dear â€”,

The Lion of God is on a break.

He sits across from me, and sets his timer to sixteen minutes.

The countdown has started as I look up from my page and smile. 

"You read a lot."

I don't know about a lot. 

Every time walking into a bookstore is an exercise in humility.

There is always more to read. 

There is actually very little I have read.
