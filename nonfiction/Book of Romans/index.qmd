Dear â€”, 

[insert more]

The Lion of God has a break.

He sits across from me, and sets his timer to sixteen minutes.

The countdown has started as I look up from my page and smile. 

"You read a lot."

I don't know about a lot. 

Every time walking into a bookstore is an exercise in humility.

There is always more to read. 

There is actually very little I have read. 

"I don't read books."

He wasn't finished.

"I read the Bible."

I ask, what's his favorite part.

"My favorite part?

Yeah, which of the books?

"Romans."

Why, Romans. 

"I'm Christian."

I smile, because I sense his pride.

It's good to be proud, not too proud.

"I was saved in February."

He was living in the D.R., becuase New York City was no good for him.

Life was hard.

He had to get away.

"So I left, stayed with family out there," he says. "I started going to a Spanish-speaking church, and hearing what they had to say."

He had felt something, so he decided to save himself. 

The water washed over him. 

But his mom needed him. 

"She needed my help with rent, so I went back."

He didn't want to.

"I got this job to help pay the bills, for the both of us."

Paul wanted to visit Rome, so he did.

"Can I take this in for you?"

I look down at the cup and saucer, up at him.

It's a very kind offer.

Yes, I say, thank you.

"See you tomorrow."
 
I don't have faith in Monday.

"Or when will I next see you?"

I wasn't sure, Thursday, Friday, or same time Sunday. 

"Well, I'll see you when I see you." 

Love, 

Elizabeth Kolling
