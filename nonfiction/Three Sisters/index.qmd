Dear —, 


Saturday, Sunday, Monday, my dad tells me what his father told him: this too shall pass.

I won’t get over it. 

One day, maybe, I’ll write about it.

Those lingering lines are intracranial and scenes from Titanic flash before me, as the water rushes in.

The four of us are there, taking cover under the gazebo.

We can't see the ground.

It rains hard, soft, and harder for longer. 

But before this, I wake up. 

I awaken at eight or so, which is late for an early birdie like me. By nature, I am a night owl.

I toss. I turn. I feel stranger than when I went to sleep. 

I make eggs on toast with toasted fennel pork sausage, for breakfast. 

I drink a liter of water, because I’m thirsty. 

I rub in the sunscreen until it’s on like skin, after nine, 75 degrees, and 76% humidity outside. 

I am wearing these baggy jeans set low and a maroon long-sleeve. 

I see the fabric darken, feel the wetness down my back. Already, I am sweating. 

I have got to move through it, that heat and high water.

I take it standing all the way down, knees bent, rocking heel to toe.

My wrist is against the metal railing, and there’s a young woman in the seat next to a young man.

She has on a crossbody bag. 

*Little Miss Sunshine* is her claim.

I think of Summer in New York at this time last year. 

The weather can change like a rerouted train, hard-fast.

You don’t know when the rainstorm is going to stop. 

I see his hand in hers. 

Hear the music playing on an endless loop in my ears. 

What is Life, George Harrison? 

What is my life, if not for you?

I make it to Fulton, go waterward where the sun is strong at 10:01. 

I take off my sunglasses inside and order a cappuccino.

There’s the MFAer in the corner. 

“Were you away?”

He asks, I answer.

The semester’s started. Book will be done by the end of the month.

I still haven’t read his short story. I tell him I’ll have time in December. 

He thinks I’m rude, doesn’t like me as a person. 

“Will you be back from now on?”

I don’t know, probably.

“I’ve been holding a grudge against you.”

Why me? 

“Because I had one extra ticket, and I invited you to the hottest literary networking event in the city.”

I tell him he should have invited someone else. I’m Irish. I did my exit. 
I run into my old roommate at the bottom of the staircase.

She shrills my name and hugs me. 

Her hair is shorter now. Her spirit, lighter. Seems to be in a better place. 

I am happy for her.

“It’s so nice to see you. Where are you now?” 

“UES.”

“Oh, it’s so sterile there.”

I don’t know, I’m a stone’s throw from the museums, and so close to Central Park. 

She lives in Chinatown with 15 people. 

“I’ll send you the info about that writer’s group.”

Say goodbye. 

Go upstairs to see about Fernando Pessoa. 

Young man behind the counter says he’s been meaning to read it. 

Pass Chatham Square, and notice it for the first time.

At 1:23, I walk Orchard street in search of answers, a bean and cheese. 

I’m off the carne. 

I’ve *been* off the carne. 

All it was, was meat and tortilla, very few beans, after a while, very little ooey gooey.

"Would you three like a photo?"

Love, 

Elizabeth Kolling
