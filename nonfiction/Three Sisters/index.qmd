Dear —, 


Saturday, Sunday, Monday, my dad tells me what his father told him: this too shall pass.

I won’t get over it. 

One day, maybe, I’ll write about it.

Those lingering lines are intracranial and scenes from Titanic flash before me, as the water rushes in.

The four of us are there, taking cover under the gazebo.

Thank God it's not a pergola. 

We can't see dry ground.

It rains hard, soft, and harder for longer. 

But before this, I wake up. 

I awaken at eight or so, which is late for an early birdie like me. By nature, I am a night owl.

I toss. I turn. I feel stranger than when I went to sleep. 

I make eggs on toast with toasted fennel pork sausage, for breakfast. 

I drink a liter of water, because I’m thirsty. 

I rub in the sunscreen until it’s on like pale skin, after nine, 75 degrees, and 76% humidity outside. 

I am wearing these low-set baggy jeans and a maroon long-sleeve. 

I see the fabric darken, feel the wetness down my back. Already, I am sweating. 

I have got to move through it, that heat and high water.

I take it standing all the way down, knees bent, rocking heel to toe.

My wrist is against the metal railing, and there’s a young woman sitting next to a young man.

She has on a crossbody bag. 

*Little Miss Sunshine* is her claim.

I think of Summer in New York at this time last year. 

The weather can change like a rerouted train, hard-fast.

You don’t know when the rainstorm is going to stop. 

I see his hand in hers. 

Hear the music playing on an endless loop in my ears. 

What is Life, George Harrison? 

What is my life, if not mine, if not for you?

How can I use my lived experience and imagination to say something that's bigger, more important, than me and spread empathy. 

I feel small in this sea.

Maybe that's what I like about New York City. 

I make it to Fulton, go waterward where the sun is strong at 10:01. 

I take off my sunglasses inside and order a few hours here.

There’s the MFAer in his corner. 

“Were you away?”

He asks, I answer.

The semester’s started. Book will be done by the end of the month.

I still haven’t read his short story. I tell him I’ll have time in December. 

He doesn’t like me as a person either. 

I'm rude.

“Will you be back from now on?”

I don’t know, probably.

We make each other laugh. 

“I’ve been holding a grudge against you.”

Why me? What did I do? 

“Uh, I had one extra ticket, and I invited you to the hottest literary event in the city and you left without saying goodbye.”

I tell him sorry, but he should have invited someone else. I’m Irish. I did my exit. 

On my way out, I run into my old roommate at the bottom of the staircase.

She enthusiastically says my name and hugs me. 

Her hair is shorter. Her spirit, lighter.

I am happy for her.

“It’s so nice to see you. So, where are you now?” 

Upper East Side, I tell her, in so many words.

“Oh, I could never live there, it’s so sterile.”

I don’t know, I’m a stone’s throw from the museums, and so close to Central Park. 

She lives in Chinatown with 15 people. 

“I’ll send you the info about that writer’s group.”

We say goodbye and promise to make plans.

I decide to go upstairs to see about Fernando Pessoa. 

The young man behind the counter has been meaning to read it. 

He asks if I'd like a bag.

I don't want it, but I do.

I pass by Chatham Square, and notice it for the first time after all this time.

I need to call Nana Pretty.

At 1:23, I walk Orchard street in search of answers.

A bean and cheese is waiting for me, hot and ready.

By the way, I’m off the carne. 

I’ve *been* off the carne. 

All it was, was meat and tortilla. Very few beans. After a while, very little ooey gooey.

I am overheated, so I sit on the bench inside to steal some AC.

I lean into where wall meets window. 

Minutes later, the woman in white approaches.

“Elizabeth?”

Yes, I say, thank you.

She smiles.

I smile back.

I don’t know why, but each time I get my order I stick my nose in it to check that the salsa crema is there at the bottom of the bag. 

Indeed it always is, they’ve never once failed me. 

I do this for two reasons. 

I have my own experience in food service, and the stakes are high.

Sometimes the sauces are forgotten. 

Sometimes systems fail.

There it is, under the surface, always. 

The system is as broken as the song I break. 

I get addicted.

I reply.

I replay.

It's neverending.

There's never peace of mind. 

I turn right on Stanton. 

I pass my sister’s favorite pizza spot, and I think of—

The bar where they look and look away with occasional eye contact.

The outdoor stools are only starting to fill, and today it smells fishy (like fish) at Allen.

I make it to the Bowery, where construction workers guide traffic.

A Sudan blocks the intersection, then does a U-turn.

I reach the place where Prince intersects Elizabeth. 

I jaywalk left after another car goes right on the green light. 

I take my chances.

Everyone has the same idea on a sunny Saturday.

A woman sunbathes on a bath towel.

I scour, until I see one lone chair next to a woman on a bench. 

I ask, are you using this.

She shakes her head, then nods.

I understand her without hearing the words.

I lift the chair with my one free hand. 

I feel strong. 

I carry the seat to a spot under the northern tree. 

The man who reads on the other side of the trunk is perturbed by my (respectful distance) nearness.

Immediately he moves his chair some three odd paces.

Three men have red cokes on a green table in the garden. 

The verde is good, spicier than I remember.

I see the sky about to rain. 

Lyrics are again in my head. 

Neil Young from the stereo.

I used to listen with my mom on early morning drives to the farmers’ market.

We like Ambulance Blues, and On the Beach.

“Though my problems are meaningless / that don’t make them go away.”

The atmosphere is doing something different.

I chew, swallow, the last bite and move my station to safety.

Under the gazebo, I get comfortable. 

I’m ready, happy, to wait out the storm. 

Three sisters take cover once it starts.

Hebba, Noor, and Leen are visiting from Houston and Dallas, Texas.

I’ve never been. 

I hear there’s a good food scene.

“What are you reading?”

A book my friend recommended, the Book of Disquiet.

It’s Hayfa’s favorite. 

“No one writes like this anymore,” she wrote me.

This book will be my ruin (in a really good way), I write back.

I have just started reading, but I can tell.

He equates the word distance with decadence. 

It’s raining hard now. 

I see the erosion, the newly raked over wood chips going with the flow, eroding the volunteer work. 

[insert more]

I ask if they'd like a photo.

Leen says, oh no.

Hebba pulls out her phone and prepares her camera for me as Noor aims a selfie at the four of us.

[insert more]

It's Sunday morning and raining outside, so I decide to take a walk.

I hear the soles of runners.

They squish against the hexagons of 5th Avenue, while the wheels of heavy loads slosh. 

The road is one way, and otherwise safe.

I'm going in the wrong direction, turning left at 96th Street. 

But first, I turn left on E 96th and follow the path towards Thorvaldsen. 

He holds a mallet and in his hand. 

I go back the way I came, and swing another left. 

Up ahead, a man exits.

I enter.

I walk west across Central Park, with a red umbrella, 

At 110, I jaywalk across Amsterdam and look at the facade.

I am the reason for the line out the door, next to order. 

[insert more]

Monday, I wake up and fall back to sleep until 8:07. 

I'm late to being early. 


Love, 

Elizabeth Kolling
