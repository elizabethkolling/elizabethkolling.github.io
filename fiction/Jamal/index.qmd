The purple sky after sunset, Jamal thought on his way up the stairs.

Day and night, the way the weather had turned as he walked Essex, made him think of Prince. Joey, who he’d happened to meet here ten years ago. The thirtieth day of September and April 21, 2016, were two dates he would only ever continue to remember. He’d never forget where he was or when he heard the news. There he was, standing outside the Black Cat, smoking a spliff (what he thought was a mere joint, at first glance), and the headline read: Prince Dead at 57. Kenya and what could have been, another album or two, were on his mind as he walked Rivington past Norfolk and Suffolk that Monday night (the eve of week two).

They mulled one together, later in the night. Really, Jamal watched. 

“Do you always mix them?”

“Hmm?”

“I mean, do you ever roll just weed?”

“Mmm,” said Joey, licking the seal. “I like the last of the tobacco, and it evens it out.”

Jamal took the F train from Delancey to 14th Street and the 2/3 back uptown to 125th Street. It was no small feat, each commute from Harlem, but it was no big deal either. He put his headphones on, and drowned out the drama of the subway car. The muscles shone through from his white beater, and a young woman sitting across the way kept looking his way. He looked the other way, saw a man with the same mess of curls Joey had had and tried not to hum the lyrics.

He worked from home, in customer service for a skincare company. It was his job to manage complaints, assist with returns, recommend alternative products to retain customers, and upsell them.
