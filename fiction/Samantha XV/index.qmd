Samantha said she had set out to Saint Lucia to spread ashes. 

“Oh,” said the technique instructor. “I’m so sorry for your loss.”

“Thank you, it *has* been hard.”

“I’m sure. So, why Saint Lucia?"

“Well, her name was Stout.” 

“Scout?”

“Stout, with a *t*.” 

“Stout, sorry."

"Because she was, you know, a chocolate Lab, on the chunkier side."

Samantha was already at the point of tears, which was impressive. 

"Would you like a tissue?" 

"No, no, thank you."

With this, she pulled a handkerchief out of her bosom and blew a wet one into it.

"Sorry, about Saint Lucia, I still don’t see the connection.”

“Saint Lucia is a major exporter of beer, and Stout is a kind of beer, so, naturally, there’s a poetry.”

“Oh, okay. So how did Stout die?”

“I find that question very insensitive, but I’ll answer it.”
