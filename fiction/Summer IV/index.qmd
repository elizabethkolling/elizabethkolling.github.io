Kim gets home from going out with her friends, and the guy she’s been seeing casually. It’s never serious, and it’s 2:30 in the morning. Summer is sitting at the dining table, earphones in. 

“How’s it going?”

“Oh, hey, I didn’t even hear you come in.” 

“How’s it going?”

“Good, just studying.”

“Whatchya studying?”

“Uh—”

“Oh, come on,” said Kim. “I know what you’re studying for, obviously, but what about?”

“Uh, organic chemistry.” 

"I had really good organic chemistry with a guy at the club tonight."

"What about Patrick?"

"We're not exclusive."

"I thought you guys were serious?"

"Do I look serious?"

Kim pulls her cheeks apart and sticks her tongue out at her.

"I can see what the guy at the club saw in you."

“Whatever, I’m taking a shower.”
