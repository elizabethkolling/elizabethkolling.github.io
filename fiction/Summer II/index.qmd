"If I saw you on the street a year later, walking First towards Houston, wearing a white t-shirt and jeans, would I say hey, stranger, long time, no talk, things good, what is your life about, what do you let rest on the tip of your tongue, in your back pocket is there ink leaking from a fountain pen, do you still try to look through the stained glass, are you reading anything boring, how's the library forming, do you have a favorite, or would I face the concrete, hope to not be seen by you, look towards my bare shoulder with a loss for words and catch the light, only to look back?"

Summer would only have one regret, however right or wrong.
