"If I saw you on the street a year later, walking First towards Houston, wearing a white t-shirt and distressed denim, would I say hey, stranger, long time, no talk (things good, how's the family, have you decided what your life's about, do you let rest or do you bite your tongue, in your back pocket is there ink leaking from a fountain pen, still trying to look through the stained glass, are you reading anything bad, believe yet in boring, how's the library forming, have you chosen a favorite), or would I face the concrete, hope to not be seen by you, look towards my bare shoulder without words and catch the light, only to look back?"

Summer would have only one regret, however right or wrong.
