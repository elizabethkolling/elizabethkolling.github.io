One day, while Pap√° was away, Child Protective Services knocked on the door and took them. 

Samantha and her brother were split up and put into foster care. Ever since, they have been separated.

She lives in a Marin City apartment complex with seven foster siblings, and vowed to find him one day. 

She rides her bike to work, and gets two jobs just to stay out of the house. 

Ethan doesn't know any of this before they start dating. Laura definitely doesn't like to hear it.
