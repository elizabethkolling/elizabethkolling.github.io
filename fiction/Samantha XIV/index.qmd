Samantha returned to her desk and all of a sudden couldn’t *control paste*. Her computer was telling her that the *ctrl* key was being held down, but her hands were on the trackpad (her finger wasn't even close to the key). That's weird, she thought. She went down to the IT department for tech support, where there was a man fingering a bag of Lays.

“Hi,” she said. “I think I may have a hardware issue.”

He swiveled his chair towards her and patted the tips of his fingers together before wiping them off on his pant legs.

"Hi, sorry, what's your issue?"

She didn't precisely know what her issue was.
