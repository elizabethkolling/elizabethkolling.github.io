“Hey,” Levi said to him a second time. 

Owen was reading Catcher in The Rye on the bus, and he was getting to the good part so it took him a second to understand that someone was talking to him and not their mother on the phone insisting on . It was Levi, one of the other freshmen, leaned back in the seat next to him, with his cleats off and legs dangling over the floor. The socks hadn’t been washed for a few games and he was a shorter fellow, second string. Sometimes, Coach would substitute him late in the second half. Levi didn’t play much, but he put his best foot forward when he was out there, and he had a way of always seeing the silver lining in any situation. 

“Hey,” Owen said back, as he turned to face him. “Levi, right?”

“Holden’s kind of a dick.” 

“Really?”

“Don’t you think?”

“I don’t know,” he said, still wondering if he'd guessed his name correctly. It'd only been two weeks since the start of the season. “I mean, I think, for me, it’s too early to tell.” 

“Huh, how far are you?” 

“Huh?”

“In the book,” he said. “What’s happening right now in the book?”

“Oh, right,” he said. “I’m at the part where he’s in a cab.”

“Which cab?”

“There’s more than one?”

“The first or the second?

Owen took his thumb out from between the pages and turned his book, closed cover to cover, so Levi could see where the book mark was. Levi saw how the width of the pages towards the back cover was thicker than he had previously thought. He sort of nodded his head in the affirmative and let out a disappointed sigh.

“There’s not more than ten,” Levi said. “But there is more than one.” 

“I’ve got that to look forward to.”

“You don’t like it so far?”

“No, I mean, I like it.” 

“It’s a classic, but I know what you mean.”

“Yeah.”

“Well, we should talk about it when you finish.”

“Yeah,” Owen said. “Okay.”	

“We could start a book club.”

“That’d be cool.”

“For sure,” Owen said as Levi turned back around and readjusted only to pull his foot to his face. Owen threw up in his mouth a little bit at the sight of it, but Levi thought the sock smelled all right. 

The school bus was making its way over rolling hills, back through West Marin, and Owen was well past the part about Holden debating the pimp, by the time he checked his phone. One missed call from his mother, and Samantha had sent him a text.

“Have a great game my left forward,” she said. “Go score some goals, I love you.” 

Her less than sign next to the number three formed a heart. He sent a colon with a closing parenthesis, and called back. 

“It was good,” he said to her. “I scored two goals!”

“Congratulations, honey!” 

“Thanks, Mom.”

“So,” Laura said. “What was the score?” 

“Two to one, us versus them.”
