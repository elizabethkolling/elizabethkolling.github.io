“We were on the Ship last time?”

“I think so, or chowder.”

"Sorry about it."

"You said you'd be gone a week."

"Are you upset?"

"Your mom's birthday was months ago, but, I mean, yeah, you chose right." 

"Every day is your birth day is how I choose to live my life, I don't know about you." 

"You don't, do you?"

"Why are you so bitter towards me lately?"
