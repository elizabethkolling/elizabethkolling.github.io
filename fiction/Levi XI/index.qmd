"Uh," Levi said, still unsure what it was. "They were all out."

"Oh, weird."

"I mean, there were none ripe ones."

"Thanks for checking."

"Yeah, no problem."

"Something the matter?"

"Potatoes?"

"Or whatever side you're planning on."

"Dad, you eat potatoes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."

"They're a staple, what can I say?"
