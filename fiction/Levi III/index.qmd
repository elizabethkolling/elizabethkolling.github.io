“Samantha just sent me a follow request.”

“Samantha sent you a follow request?” 

“Yeah.”

Ethan sat up on the towel and looked out at the waves, wondering whether they were sneak attacks.  

“What?”

“Nothing.”

“You mad?”

“No.”

“You don’t have Instagram.”

“Yeah.”

“So it’s not like she can send one to you.”

“Yeah.”

“You should have one.”

“Huh?” 

“Instagram.”

“Oh, no.”

“Do you want one?”

“Uh.”

“I can make you one.”

“I’m not going to make an Instagram just so Samantha can send me a friend request.”

“Follow*.”

“Whatever,” he said. “I’ll see her in class.”

“Yeah, okay.”

“You’re the worst.”

“Here, give me your phone.”
