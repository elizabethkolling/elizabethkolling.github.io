It wasn’t Saturday, December 20, after the semester's end. The eggs weren’t there, in rows of six, under the heat lamp. Beyond the window pane, Sara couldn’t see through to the kitchen where two cooks were angling in their own corners. The one with the double chin oiled no cast iron pan handed to him by the other who crossed into the dining room towards the bar seating and glass case of small plates and long platters. She was here, inhaling no scent of sardines, anchovies and cocktail sauce, with her head down in her home town. The city of pomp and circumstance, she thought as she shifted her weight on the wooden high chair, which wasn't red leather, and wrapped her right twice around her left leg towards *Adam’s Curse*. If she had nothing else in this life, no other reason for being, she’d have one thing: *a thought for no one’s ear but his*.

Sara had found him, pure as the driven snow, and then lost her way as he had.
