Red Bird had this need for speed. She started walking faster, with her left-side shoulder hanging low like the tule fog that kept inching closer towards Mount Tam. She had the sense that the man behind her was unanointed and following her, so she started to scream, but it was as if the people walking past her couldn't hear a goddamn thing. 

"Help me!" 

"Stop this man!"

"He's following me, too closely!"
