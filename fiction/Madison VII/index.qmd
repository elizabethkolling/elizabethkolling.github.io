"I cringe every time I hear that lyric."

"Eff off."

"Sun-dried? What's a sun-dried. Because all I'm picturing is the old lady who lives upstairs."

"What do you want from me? It rhymed."

"Don't think so."

"Time. Dried. Whatever. It's alliterative. Summertime. Sun-dried." 

"Just used sun-kissed." 

"Summertime. Sun-kissed. Weak *i*. Sounds terrible.

"Sunburn."

"Absolutely not." 

"OH! I got it." 

"Okay, give it to me."

"Heirloom tomatoes in the summertime, and I know you want to taste that *sunrise* 

"Ugh."
