“Why was Sally always such a hard ass towards me?”

Maddie brought her hand up to her mouth and turned her face to the writer’s wall to hide her laugh. 

“Well hello to you too, Maximilian.”

“Hey, sorry, I’ve been keeping that in for some years, but I’ve genuinely always wondered.”

“Did you not know?”

“No, know what?” 

“Sally had like the hugest crush on you.”

“What?”

“Big time.”

“I had no clue,” he said, holding back. “I had the biggest crush on you.” 

“You did?”

“Yeah. I thought it was so obvious, I mean—”

“It wasn’t to me.”

“I wish I’d told you then.”

“Why, so we could hold hands on the way to fifth period?”

“No.”

“We were just kids.”

“It was high school.” 

“Plus, I wouldn’t have done that to Sally. I wanted to be a good friend. I think that’s just what any of us wants.”

“I heard about her and Oliver.” 

“Yeah.”

“I’m sorry, that’s pretty shitty…of the both of them…but especially her…I’m guessing you’re not that great of friends anymore?”

“Pretty much.”

“Every day for six years I wanted to tell you how beautiful you are.”

“Max, thanks.”

“It’s true.”

“My—”

“I think people should go after what they want, full force.” 

“It’s not always that simple.”

“Of course it is. Life’s short.”   

“My boyfriend’s actually meeting me here,” she said, turning towards the street to pluck him from the crowd of passers-by and people in line. “I think you’d love him.”
