“Do you have a buck?”

“Hey," he'd say. "Can I get a buck?”

“Can I bum a buck off you?”

"Are you gonna give me a buck or just stand there."

"Please don't walk away, I'm a war veteran in need of a dollar."

"All I'm asking for is a single dollar bill, but if you only have twenty bucks, I'll take that too."

"If you give me a buck, I'll pay you back, five percent interest."

"Loan me a buck?"

"Don't be a shitty person, donate!"

The gentleman methamphetamine user was known in those parts as Buck Wilde, because he’d go up to every stranger asking for a single dollar with a wild look in his eyes.
