(At a certain point, Book Club with Ethan isn't working out. So, he has to take matters into his own hands and just read the Whale on his own.)

Dear Mom, 

The book I read before this was Moby Dick, because it reminded me of you. Any way, there's this captain. Or, co-captain. Or, really he's the second in command to Captain Ahab. I guess you could call him the first mate. His name is Starbuck, and he has one requirement for the men on his ships. They need to know fear. Without fear, there is no capacity for courage. Fear, he argues, is the catalyst of courage.

Love,

Your Levi
