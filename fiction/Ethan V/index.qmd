He took the whole bail lid jar and also two family size bags of sea salt and vinegar. The burning off of the taste buds was never worth it, but he couldn’t just have one. It was his car, so Levi didn’t question the clumsy approach or the pink in his eyes. He sat in the passenger seat, with a silent prayer and let his best friend drive him to Stinson.
