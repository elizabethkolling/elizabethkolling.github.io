They went camping each summer for Laura's birthday, which was June 19, but things were different this year, arguably the most important. The boys were going in different directions after high school. Plus, she and Don had kissed and hadn't talked in months. He was, in part, the reason for the distance. While Levi had been understanding, it was Ethan everyone was worried about. He wasn't the most mature when it came to perfect things changing in ways that he couldn't control. It reminded him of the death of his father. In any case, Don was planning not to go. And yet, as he lay in bed on the eve of their tradition, he couldn't help but add soil to the seed that his son planted.

"Dad, no offense but this is ridiculous," Levi had said. "You're both acting like high schoolers."
