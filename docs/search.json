    "text": "May 30, 2025\nDear —,\nIt’s 7:44 pm on Friday, May 30, 2025, which means I just missed my train, and the next F to Downtown & Brooklyn is in 13 minutes. Is it possible just to be, the luckiest unlucky person, or not to be? Now I see a perfectly clean seat to sit on, and have the opportunity to write whilst I wait. It’s my first time sitting on a subway platform bench, in all the (seven) years I’ve lived in this inspiring, (only slightly) dirty city, and the F train is rocking into the 57th Street station as I think of all the years we’ve called each other friends. Part of me wonders how in the world thirteen minutes have passed, and I’ve only managed to pen this much on the back of a postcard. I feel like the woman in the painting, who reminded me of you, deep in thought, with books on the table in front of her, I’m sure, a writing utensil in her right hand, and an infinite number of ideas in her head. She’s very fashionably dressed. Her green scarf reminds me of the denim skirt you wore, and polka-dotted long-sleeve henley, when we met up at the MET earlier this spring. This book I hope will offer you something along your creative path. I look forward to reading what you write, and one day seeing your name on a book cover, in the store of some independent bookseller on the lower east side of Manhattan, like Sweet Pickle Books, or McNally Jackson on Fulton. Rooting for you, and in your corner—always. Happy birthday, and summer solstice.\nLove,\nElizabeth Rose Aurora Bee Rain Kolling"

    "text": "Her son had a lot of friends from high school, to start, but he had a way of dwindling the circle down like it was a jolly rancher getting rotated about in the mouth of the girl with the long brown hair from freshman year. He was a nice guy, and the other girls liked him too, but he didn’t much mind them. He only had eyes for the one, and he was more intent on what he was reading. The guys on the soccer team called him grim or the reader or the grim reader, one after the other, on the way to games.\n“How’s it going, Grim?”\n“What’s the reader reading today?”\n“Watch out the grim reader’s right behind you,” Cole would say in the seat behind him on the bus.\nIt was just fun and games, a play on the grim reaper, because he always had this look on his face when he was staring down at a page, like he was depressed or something. It was a cool November in his soul, he’d say to the guys, all serious, just to freak them out, but they always knew he was messing around. The thing he hated about being on the soccer team was that it always took him away from the school day. He’d have to leave Western Philosophy early, and he always felt like he was missing the part where everything made sense. He liked Plato best, because Plato was a bit of a romantic despite what the Stoics said.\nSomething good did come of it, though. The one girl with the long brown hair who always sat in what seemed to be the farthest seat possible from him, turned around one day and volunteered to take notes and send them to him. She had this incredible handwriting, and her notes were extremely meticulous, not sporadic or like Pollock in front of a tawny canvas. They were complete, converging, and read like little short stories. She was definitely smarter than him, which is why he loved her. He’d had this crush on her for at least a month into the note-taking before he mustered the courage to ask her out. He asked her if she wanted to go get ice cream, and that was that. They both liked mint chip, and before his mother knew it: Owen, which means noble or well-born or son of destiny, had a girlfriend in high school.\nLaura hated that they were together. She hated the girlfriend and this was revealed first in small ways but then pretty obviously at a certain point in time, maybe halfway through junior year, so he knew it’d never amount to much. She was pretty and a free spirit, she showed him things, and sometimes didn’t wear shoes when she walked around which upset him and was the only other major tension. It was good for now, not forever, and he was fine either way. Senior year came and graduation day, walking across the stage, and he broke it off with Samantha a few weeks later before she left for college. She was going on a pre-orientation water rafting trip, and he was able to do that sort of thing—be present and apparently sincere, but critical of himself and others on the inside. He had his best kept secrets and he cared a lot about what others thought, especially his mother who had decided early on to hold a grudge, never let it go, and let it fester like her toenail fungus, which she painted with prescription Ciclopirox every morning after yoga.\n“I want you to experience everything in its fullness,” he had said to her. “Not in distance.”\nEven in the bitter end she believed he was sweet, and maybe she looked just too good in flip flops."

    "text": "Laura and Owen and Levi and Don loaded into a car together and drove up north each summer for camping, as a family.\nThey weren’t family, but they were as close to it as Grandpa C. was suave with his Capper & Capper suit. He’d wear it, ivory and tweed, every other day-before-Christmas Eve, even though Laura called it her “Winter Solstice” party. Laura would throw a big party each year during the holidays and invite all of Owen’s friends and their families. There’d be charcuterie boards but in weird places, which always seemed to coincide with some home improvement that finally completed the house and that Laura was very excited to tell people about, so finding the food was somewhat of a hunt and always a source of gossip on drives home. For instance, one year, Laura put a charcuterie board out on the back deck despite the bitter cold weather they were having, as a way of leading guests to the new landscaping. It was all native species, and drought resistant.\n“I just want to do my part,” she said. “In times like these.”\nThis year, she put the charcuterie board upstairs in the old guest room that she’d recently converted into an art studio. She paid someone to do it, but it took months beyond the original quote and the whole thing was a nightmare. By the time winter solstice passed and the party came around, the room consisted of blank canvases despite a bunch of brushes that’d clearly been used. The paint was dry, still coating the bristles.\n“I just love it,” she said to the Townsend family who stood at the doorway, careful not to enter. “It’s a dream, you know…my very own easel”\nLaura walked further into the recesses of the room and glided her palm across the stool, making her way towards the window.\n“Sitting on this seat, watching the sun rise.”\nThere was one painting: a four by four of the color green, centimeters thick and projecting from the canvas, with a single patch of blue left of center. She titled it, “Pubbenivasanussati,” which she translated for the Townsends as “the remembrance of former births.”\nThe death of his wife is what changed the holidays for him. All these years later, Grandpa C. would pack into his little Volvo and drive the eight hours or so straight from Brentwood, CA, the last nice part of Los Angeles, or the City of no more Angels, as he’d refer to Home in his old age. He’d stay for as long as it took him to re-connect with his grandson, regain feeling in his legs, or finish off the Humboldt Fog. He swore by it—cheese on a cracker, eating standing, walking as a lifestyle, and saw driving the scenic route as the only exception for sitting idle."
