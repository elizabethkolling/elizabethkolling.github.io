    "text": "May 30, 2025\nDear —,\nIt’s 7:44 pm on Friday, May 30, 2025, which means I just missed my train, and the next F to Downtown & Brooklyn is in 13 minutes. Is it possible to be, the luckiest unlucky person, or not to be? Now I see a perfectly clean seat to sit on, and have the opportunity to write whilst I wait. It’s my first time sitting on a subway platform bench, in all the (seven) years I’ve lived in this inspiring, (only slightly) dirty city, and the F train is rocking into the 57th Street station as I think of all the years we’ve called each other friends. Part of me wonders how in the world thirteen minutes have passed, and I’ve only managed to pen this much on the back of a postcard. I feel like the woman in the painting, who reminded me of you, deep in thought, with books on the table in front of her, I’m sure, a writing utensil in her right hand, and an infinite number of ideas in her head. She’s very fashionably dressed. Her green scarf reminds me of the denim skirt you wore, and polka-dotted long-sleeve henley, when we met up at the MET earlier this spring. This book I hope will offer you something along your creative path. I look forward to reading what you write, and one day seeing your name on the cover in the storefront of some independent bookseller on the lower east side of Manhattan, like Sweet Pickle Books, or McNally Jackson on Fulton. Rooting for you, and in your corner—always. Happy birthday, and summer solstice.\nLove,\nElizabeth Rose Aurora Bee Rain Kolling"

    "text": "I saw him in the street that day in early June, hand on her shoulder, with her arm around his waist.\nWait, I remember. She was wearing a wide brim, and the hat was like her ankle-cut linen pants: white. It was the kind of white that no working woman or man would or could ever wear. She was one of those mothers who waded through the mornings and somehow stumbled upon afternoon, waiting for the time to turn to two. She’d pack a snack and make her way to the elementary school pick-up zone, where the first car in line belonged to the other Jennifer in front of her. Her name was Laura Chase and she was the same as the other mothers there, with hours to kill and always complaining, claiming to be busy and not like mine who was hard-working but had taste about her. In her free time, Laura liked to talk about the rounded notes of red wine and sit on the back porch of her million and four dollar house, where the nearby pool was heated and salt water. Years later, when no one was home to swim in it, she’d invite her boyfriend over for a quick dip, in and out, or her son’s friends from high school who were going to the local college a few towns over.\nThey even called it community."
