He just sits on the sidewalk with his back arched against the building and neck limp. People pass him, and it always makes me sad. I’m one of them,” said Max without eye contact.\n“Thanks for sharing,” Mr. P. said. He had sensed the silence starting to overwhelm the nervous systems of the still impressionable freshmen. “Yes, Sara?”\n“Do you mind clarifying what it is that makes you sad, since you used the common pronoun? What exactly is the ‘it,’ I mean? Are you implying that people should be stopping?”"

He was still annoyed about the thing Levi had said, which was totally not cool, about his girlfriend, but he knew that Levi was hard of hearing and he knew he had a tendency to mumble so he just considered it a miscommunication and tried to brush it off.\n“We’ll come back to it.”\n“Okay.”\n“What else?”\n“Well, nevermind.”\n“What? No. Tell me.”\n“I don’t know,” Ethan said. “I guess I saw some connection to your earlier theory.”\n“Pray tell.”\n“Okay, starting with what, the second, no what is it, the fourth paragraph, I guess, of Chapter 2.”\n“Yeah?”\n“So, Ishmael has spent a Saturday night, Sunday, and Sunday night in New Bedford, and only then he looks for a place to sleep, right?”\n“Um…”\n“So, I think he either stayed awake the whole night into Sunday, or he slept on a bench or in the streets, you know, like a drug addict, like what you were saying before.\n“Um, hmm, interesting, but I’m pretty sure it’s still Saturday when he starts to look for a place to sleep,” Levid said, moving his pointer finger down the page. “Yeah, here, it says, ‘now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford.’ So, the ‘following before me’ meaning Sunday is still to come.”\n“Oh,” he said. “I totally missed that, and I guess I read it the wrong way. I read the word ‘having’ and then I just read the rest of it as if he had already had Saturday night, then Sunday, and Sunday night again, my bad.”\nThey sat in silence, flipping through pages.\n“No, wait,” Ethan said. “Here, here’s why I must’ve thought it was Sunday. There’s this lines about how it’s the last day of the week, which I thought, of course, meant Sunday.”\n“I thought Saturday was the last day of the week.”\n“Jesus.”\n“Yeah, I think so, maybe I’m wrong, I thought it had to do with Catholicism or something,” said Levi.\n“You’re Catholic, right?”\n“Yeah, you?”\n“Kind of.”"

    "text": "Samantha didn’t much care for Shakespeare, but she took the gut feeling with a grain of salt.\nShe hadn’t actually read any of his plays, Romeo and Juliet, for instance, but she already knew they weren’t for her, of course, because everyone else loved them. She preferred the salt of the earth and not to fawn over popular culture, out of principle. However, Shakespeare (she heard) was a woman, so maybe she would read him one day. She was a feminist before anything, even though she was in love and wanted to get married one day and have a family. She wouldn’t cut the crust off. That’s for sure. For now, that kind of theatre was not to be touched (too pretentious), not to mention gate-kept by those drawn to it (actors, namely, steeped like tea in self-regard). The language was too British, posh and high brow for her. She resolved to play Nina and only read real writing. Life was already complicated enough. She wanted simple moments, straightforwardness, a seagull eating a chicken wing for no other reason than it was on the ground. Chekhov was her favorite, but she didn’t get the part. She was set to play Masha instead. It bummed her out because she couldn’t relate at all to the character. She was happy, head over heals for Ethan, and she didn’t own one thread of black clothing.\nAside from the deep-seated pessimism, she was a sweet person."

    "text": "In the City of Fog, City by the Bay, on a Holy Sunday, church bells chimed and signaled lunch time, and so it was: they ate under a sun unseen, the sons and daughters and androgynous children of God. Oh, how they ate sundry lunches in each Cardinal direction.\nDue east, the gentleman methamphetamine user flicked a lighter beneath her silver spoon and licked his lips as eyes, wide, watched the ice turn to ocean. Ice turned to ocean and then to dust in the bowl, as he pointed the bevel and pulled the plunger. The viscous elixir rose like Christ, up the barrel.\nThe barrel ached in the Tenderloin of San Francisco, where heels were tender and none was well. None was well, but all were alive to feel the barrel, belly and loins, and all below ache. The head and heart ached above all, like the belly and loins of the gentleman methamphetamine user whose body had become a cavern place to put his pain. His pain was scalene, an unholy trinity of aches.\nHeartache. Headache. Body aches.\n“Them three together is the feeling,” said the voice in the head of the gentleman methamphetamine user whose knack had always been numbers, geometry, but never grammar or the English language at large. “In that order, the aches that ebb and flow and underlie everything, these are them.”\n“They!” Sister Mary had screamed. “These are they!”\nThe gentleman methamphetamine user remembered the scream of Sister Mary, still some Spanish, and afternoons of his youth spent in classroom 819.\n“Her whose laws of language were a weapon, and whose ruler was like a yard stick.”\nShe whose ruler was like a yard stick, striking down on the gentleman methamphetamine user, had not seen his socks leaking the unsold chocolate or the linoleum floor where a puddle formed. He formed the memory, remembering his sweet tooth and third grade side hustle, the black market business of stashing candy bars before school, after paper route, at the Sunset corner store as the sun rose, wearing khaki pants with a long hem and oversized white tube socks stuffed chock-full of Pay Days and Babe Ruths and Butterfingers and Twix bars, working first the monkey bars and then turning treats around the tetherball pole for ten cents on the margin, all to appease and garner the favor of his friends, the sugar fiends of the playground, at lunchtime. He remembered that one Holy Monday that had been slow and oddly hot. He remembered the unsold chocolate and how uncomfortably it melted in his socks, leaking further into the shoes, and he remembered how he wouldn’t dare raise his hand for the restroom so soon after lunchtime and risk the reign of her ruler. He remembered how the voice in his head had taunted him, even then, and how slow the better half of his mind moved in the afternoon, like a sprinkler leak above one lush patch of Mission Dolores, and how all he cared about throughout the lesson on pronouns was counting his grass (coins) and calculating lost profit.\n“Drip-drip-drip.”\n“Them?” he had answered, in the second row from the back of the classroom.\n“They!” Sister Mary had screamed, striking down on him, only to skid betwixt the desks.\nThe gentleman methamphetamine user remembered the skinned flesh, the skid, slip and fall, of Sister Mary, and the sound of her crushed pelvis like chalk across the chalkboard, and he remembered the unsavory sight as she lay there below, broken-boned and brittle. He had felt unwell, with a belly full of cow’s milk, peanut brittle, and Pay Days.\nThese were they, his thoughts growing cyclically like the tide. This was the fate of the gentleman methamphetamine user whose body ache was a sneak attack wave, sweeping his child into the Pacific, and whose headache and heartache were like the fog—in and out, endlessly. Neither here nor there and then everywhere, the fog reminded him of her. The fog always reminded him of Father John-Michael Fromm whose unconditional love was the source of their suffering.\n“Unconditional love,” Father John-Michael Fromm had said during Noon Mass at Saint Teresa of Sunset some twenty or so insufferable years ago.\nThe gentleman methamphetamine user had been only a boy back then, but he remembered. As a young man all these years later, he remembered: Good Friday at School of the Ascension; Saturday at the Ferry Building Farmers’ Market; Holy Sunday through stained glass. He remembered each day, beginning and ending, as if it were yesterday. It was spring, late April.\n“May!”\nMaybe it was early June or mid-July. The sun was shining, and the birds were screaming. The gophers, undisturbed, were disturbing the peace. The soil above and below, in and around the baseball diamond, was all in a ruin as a stubborn cherry plum tree bore its sour bounty behind the dugout.\n“Without equivocation and poor tenses!” said the voice in the head of the gentleman methamphetamine user whose habit had gotten out of hand.\nThe gentleman methamphetamine user had a habit, among other ailments. He had hyperthymesia, a photographic memory and an encyclopedic mind, but a habit of telling himself and every set of eyes half-truths. In truth, the sun was not shining in late April or May or early June. The sun had not in fact shone through the fog that Friday, which was far from good, and he remembered the way to that small room at the end of the long corridor.\n“Yesterday is today,” Father John-Michael Fromm had whispered as he led the boy astray that Friday. “Today is tomorrow, the first day of the rest of your life, how does that sound?”\nThere were the Good Fridays and the bad Fridays, the baseball games lost and won. There was the unconditional love of his life and her father’s avocados. There were the Holy Sundays and sermons.\n“The demon stands before you,” said the voice as the gentleman methamphetamine user who aimed a skeptical brow before shaking his head, no. “No, you liar.”\n“Unconditional love,” Father John-Michael Fromm had said, interrupting himself in the middle of his own speech about the ascension of the Virgin Mary.\nDuring Noon Mass at Saint Teresa of Sunset some twenty or so insufferable years ago, Father John-Michael Fromm sent forth a fateful pair of words and a pregnant pause that would come to haunt the gentleman methamphetamine user like the miscarriage of the proud pregnant mother, seated in the front row. She was proud of him there, and neither knew of the imminent ache, at the time. The proud pregnant mother smiled wide and delicately held her belly as the boy’s eyes watched narrowly. The gentleman methamphetamine user watched as Father John-Michael Fromm inhaled and looked longingly out the window. A kaleidoscope of colors seized him. He saw red and yellow, vermillion and amber, chartreuse, green, blue, indigo, magenta and violet, violence in the home, the thorn-adorned rose in the bleeding hands of Her, and the scene of Jesus meeting his afflicted mother. Only he saw the pacific exhale, Father John-Michael Fromm inhaling a memory of his own, and only He saw the boy seeing.\nSee, Father John-Michael Fromm saw all. He heard all. Father John-Michael Fromm had eyes in the back of his head and the ears of a serval or something, but he himself was prey, and the boy knew this to be true too. Like a moth to a flame, Father John-Michael Fromm tweaked his neck toward the boy and sent forth a wan smile. The boy smiled back, standing there beneath the altar, holding the wine or the water or the napkins or whatever Father John-Michael Fromm needed as he broke his silence.\n“Unconditional love is the source of all suffering.”\nThe life of the altar boy thereafter was all suffering, a series of aches relieved in small rooms, and the days were all the same. The first day of the rest of his life had come to be about forgetting, remembering, and getting well again, endlessly.\nThere was no end. None was well in the Tenderloin of San Francisco, where a wind tornado violently whirled a used napkin into the salty air. Eyes, wide, watched it waft like the feather of a blue-winged teal. The lady methamphetamine user, known in these parts as Red Bird, pressed her thumb and forefinger together, pinching the prize. Her hunt was complete, and Red Bird clung to the canvas, watching as the gentleman methamphetamine user prepared a place setting.\nRed Bird softly tapped her lover’s knee cap, clinging too to the pen, stolen from the mom-and-pop tobacco market nearby. Red Bird waited for a flicker, but the flick of his lighter beneath her silver spoon did not inspire Red Bird. Inspiration struck elsewhere in the Tenderloin of San Francisco, across the way, where lay the fentanyl users. There were seven keeled, and one still standing.\nThe fentanyl users whose numbers had been but three the day before yesterday and contained to the south-west corner of Hyde and O’Farrell, were now eight, inching further, as if the belly and loins were their manifest destiny and theirs to charter, disturbing the peace, too close for comfort. Red Bird watched with narrow eyes and a pointed brow as the last standing fentanyl user jammed the needle into his left foot. Crimson poured out, and the fentanyl user pulled the plunger. She had heard one shot was all it took, for their backs like feral cats’ to arch over, and shook her head in disbelief. The needle fell from the palm, the spine curled like a sleeping infant in fetal position. Eight of them now lay like ducks in a row, across the way.\n“Turk is not their territory,” said Red Bird, whose own territory was uncharted, typically where business was good and married men regular, but lately here, next to the gentleman methamphetamine user, who sat next to her on the curb of Turk Street, shoulder-to-shoulder, outside Tobacco & Market.\n“Taco and Market” said the voice in the head of the gentleman methamphetamine user who pinched the used needle as nonchalantly as those Lucky Strikes between the thumb and forefinger of his late father. The gentleman methamphetamine user looked at the light-emitting diodes, and the semi-dead sign of the mom-and-pop tobacco market. The lowercase ‘B’ had gone dark since the last time he’d taken a walk down Turk, and his father had died when he was barely twelve years old. “You are starving, my son. You haven’t eaten for nineteen days, but we’re not breaking fast for that shit.”\n“I hate you,” said the gentleman methamphetamine as he looked away sharply. His eye caught a pigeon who flew overhead. He followed the wingspan, mesmerized, wanting to fly.\nThe pigeon landed at the feet of an old woman in a wheelchair who was regularly on display at the far corner. On the north-west corner of Leavenworth and Golden Gate Avenue, the old woman in the wheelchair dipped bird bones, drums and wings from KFC, in a bucket of bleach and scattered the seed across the asphalt concrete. The lone pigeon pecked clean a chicken wing and seconds later dropped dead.\n“You killed him!” screamed the gentleman methamphetamine user.\nThe old woman in the wheelchair paid no mind to the gentleman methamphetamine user. She decried society between cries, screaming at the indifferent sun. It was a song for deaf ears and a sight for sore eyes. The gentleman methamphetamine user plugged his eardrums, but he couldn’t look away.\n“Look away!” the old woman in the wheelchair screamed. “Don’t look at me! Mine-mine-mine! I, the morning bird in mourning, mourn you! You! You! You! It is you to rue noon! It is you I mourn! I mourn the boyish hubris of birthed men! I mourn the name your father gave you, and the way your Father made you! I mourn the pavers and paved road! I mourn the plane and places to go! Be present where you plant your feet and face what you have made of the City of Fog, City by the Bay, on a Holy Sunday! You excavated oil and gas and made the chasms of hydraulic fracturing! Bottled water and stolen springs, shadow banking and crude futures staining American dreams! Climate change and broken accords! Milk alternative spilled across the cowardly sidewalk! Tesla stock! Delivery as afterthought! The blood is on your hands as Michoacán avocados blanket black, burnt toast in styrofoam! Takeout to your doorstep and ne’er a tip! Pay tuition to own your education! Sell or be sold! Or refuse. Live like I do! I love my life! Do you love your trailer towns, AC, and trust fund? I inherit the oppressive sun, systemic oppression and jail cells! Ho Hos and Snickers running low! Commissary and criminal justice like skin cancer. Unlawful simile! Overused alliteration and unused napkins! Leftovers sold again as kitchen-sink stir fry. Failed restaurants and Yelp in pursuit of capital! No! Consumer surplus, sore thumbs and Type A coffee drinkers’ stained teeth! Blue Bottle flies feasting on stale meat! Barbecues abandoned! Forsake your fate and synonym! Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Mother of God! I am the same as you are!”\n“You and I are not the same,” whispered the gentleman methamphetamine user to himself as the old woman in the wheelchair continued to sing her song, sober, as she always did, on and on.\n“Battery is an explosive!” she shrilled. “Don’t answer the phone!”\nThe old woman in the wheelchair whose mind had, seventeen times, survived shock therapy could go on for hours like this. This, he knew. The gentleman methamphetamine user knew, and knew better than to delay lunch for the free show. He prepared a place setting, setting down her silver spoon, only to feel Her ruler strike his wrist.\n“Ow!” he said, holding his forearm.\n“What’s wrong?” asked Red Bird without an answer.\n“Forks on the left!” Sister Mary had screamed. “Spoons and knives on the right!”\nThe sun cut through the pale, and the gentleman methamphetamine user remembered the scream of Sister Mary, the summer of his youth between grades five and six spent in etiquette school. He remembered his grandmother’s china, silver forks and silver spoons and silver knives and the pride in his pregnant mother’s eyes at Thanksgiving, as he set the table for the whole family. He remembered family dinners on Good Fridays and bad Fridays, morning prayer, penitence and detention, little league, and he remembered the scent of lemon rosemary, chicken and pitted prunes and red peppers and green olives together in one dish to be savored and eaten slowly at the table set by him. His belly and heart ached in the Tenderloin of San Francisco, as he saw her silver spoon, which lay there, on his left side.\n“Idiot,” said the voice as the gentleman methamphetamine user sighed. He knew he had sinned, aching for his failure and failed education, and sought salvation in another order of eating\n“Ladies first,” he said to her.\n“I’m not a lady,” said Red Bird.\nA pin dropped in the Tenderloin of San Francisco, and the gentleman methamphetamine user wasn’t sure of anything anymore.\n“Sure,” said the voice in the head of the gentleman methamphetamine user. “Red Bird is not a lady, but she is surely a woman. I assure you, you have already taken Red Bird down and come to know her shores. Just beyond the bluff, remember? And you did so just this morning, as the sun was rising and as the mourning bird was screaming.”\nThe voice in the head of the gentleman methamphetamine user assured him of her sex and spoke the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It was all true. He had already taken Red Bird down and come to know her shores, just beyond the bluff. He remembered. He had done so just that morning as the sun rose and as the mourning bird had started to sing.\n“Did you not sail over sea?” the old woman in the wheelchair had screamed. “Charter plane for paradise! Pave road! Drive along the winding bluffs, once? Beat them down further with heavy tires, the weight of your canted cars and sliding scale morality? Pray they pull you over? Beg justice be served to you on your silver spoon? Yes! You let legislation, graphic tees, bumper stickers and failed systems speak for you while you unbuckled and played backseat jello, felt the touch of another’s shoulder against your own. Let your loved ones lean lest they fall, and they fell! Yes! You let your loved ones lean so far they’ve fallen. Even I heard the sirens as you sped full speed around the bend. Did you even ponder physics? Centripetal force? Friction!”\nRed Bird still felt the friction and felt herself taken further by her lover who tenderly searched her varicose leg for a vein, but she did not have the look of an in-love person. Red Bird wore hate on a long face, though she did not hate her lover. She hated the fentanyl users who lay all pacific across the way. Looking, just looking, Red Bird finally felt the flicker and, with a flick of the wrist, penned a poem on the used napkin. Eastern Tenderloin, she wrote.\nAddicts sleep, like sloths in the streets, but I’ve a dream back west, wistaria and burgundy, wonted, awakening.\nRed Bird read the poem back, and didn’t entirely hate it. She set down the stolen pen, folded the used napkin into a tiny square, and tucked it into the back pocket of the gentleman methamphetamine user, wearing her heart on her sleeve as she always had."

    "text": "Catherine was waiting up for him downstairs while Sara was over at Maddie’s (standing Monday sleepover during summer), and it was almost midnight when the keys jostled in the lock. She had been on her phone, scrolling Facebook, but managed to pick up a book without a peep by the time she heard the door creak open.\nHis phone hit the hardwood floors as he bent down to untie his Oxfords. They were dark brown leather, and his footsteps were as heavy as ever through the breezeway. His lack of precision was a good sign, Catherine thought, and he didn’t seem surprised to see her.\n“Hello, my love,” he said, gently holding each of her shoulders as he leaned in for a kiss on the cheek. She took it on the chin. He didn’t smell like alcohol, which was maybe a bad sign, she thought. Having an affair sober was even worse, and she would rather he have fallen into a hard drug addiction than so easily out of love with her. But, that’s not love to think that way, so she bowed her head in shame at the thought. What had she not done? Nothing. She’d been massaged and micro-needled and rose-watered in lieu of perfumed and manicured, overall everything. She hadn’t at all lost her youtful looks. She looked the same as she had in college, for heaven’s sake, so what gave?\n“Hi,” she said without flourish. “How was your day today?”\n“Busy,” he said, leaning back in the grandfather chair across from her. She saw his choice of seat as a bad sign, because he wasn’t going out of his way to be close to her. He knew very well physical touch was her love language.\n“How was work?”\n“Busy,” he said.\n“You stayed late.”\n“Investor meetings.”\n“Are you hungry?”\n“I am hungry.”\n“You haven’t eaten dinner?”\n“No, I may make something.”\n“I’ll make you something.”\n“No, that’s okay, actually.”\n“So you’re not hungry.”\nCatherine was suspicious, and there was silence a moment.\n“Where’s Sara?”\n“Maddie’s.”\n“Oh, right, Monday.”\n“Hey, are they?”\n“No, James, jeez.”\n“Sara likes Max.”\n“Who’s this Max?”\n“He’s a very nice boy.”\n“I think I’d like to meet him to see about that.”\n“James, they go to school together.”\n“Where does he live?”\n“I believe he’s on the West side.”\n“Where?”\n“What does it matter.”\n“I want to know if he’s good enough for our daughter.”\n“James, I don’t think we need to worry about that.”\n“Why?”\n“I have a feeling Max likes Maddie.”\n“Why do you think that?”\n“It’s just a feeling,” Catherine said. “I saw the three of them together. I always see him on Saturdays.”\n“Why is that?”\n“He wants to be a painter.”\n“I don’t like him.”\n“James, don’t be so judgmental, you haven’t even met the poor boy.”\n“Then let’s have him over.”\n“What?”\n“Sara’s birthday is coming up, so let’s throw her a party.”\n“That sounds nice, I’ll plan everything.”\n“So how do you know Max likes Maddie instead of our Sara?”\n“I saw him look at her the way you used to look at me.”\n“Used to, honey, what are you talking about?”\n“I don’t know,” Catherine said. “You tell me.”\n“My eyes are weak from looking at reports all day, but that has nothing to do with you, my love. I feel as strongly towards you today as I did the day we met. Even more so.”\n“I’d like to think so.”\n“My love only grows.”\n“I don’t want there to be secrets between us.”\n“I tell you everything that matters.”\n“No, see, that there, that’s not enough. I want to know everything, not just what you deem to matter.”\n“Okay,” he said, rising from his chair. He stepped towards the couch and knelt before her.\n“Why are you looking at me like that.”\n“Because I love you very much.”\n“Then why don’t you come home earlier.”\n“Can we talk about this in the morning?”\n“No.”\n“Please.”\n“No, James.”\n“Pretty please?”\nShe couldn’t resist him when he looked at her like that. After all, she knew that look and believed she was the woman he loved, the only one (besides Sara) he had chosen to build his life around. So, she let him as he leaned in to kiss her."

Here, the chapel chapter, six, it says, ‘…New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping.’”\n“So he’s referring to this Water Street in the Battery?”\n“No, the Seaport.”\n“Oh, makes sense,” said Ethan. “That’s where the ports are.”\n“Now, they’re mere piers.”"

    "text": "I saw him in the street that day in early June, hand on her shoulder, with her arm around his waist.\nWait, I remember. She was wearing a wide brim, and the hat was like her ankle-cut linen pants: white. It was the kind of white that no working woman or man would, or could, ever wear. She was one of those mothers who waded through the mornings and somehow stumbled upon afternoon, waiting for the time to turn to two. She’d pack a snack and make her way to the elementary school pick-up zone, where the first car in line belonged to the other Jennifer in front of her. Her name was Laura Chase and she was the same as the other mothers there, with hours to kill and always complaining, claiming to be busy and not like the one who was hard-working and had no taste to her. In her free time, Laura liked to talk about the rounded notes of red wine and sit on the back porch of her million and four dollar house, where the nearby pool was heated and salt water. Years later, when no one was home to swim in it, she’d invite her boyfriend over for a quick dip, in and out, or her son’s friends from high school who were going to the local college a few towns over."

Herb wasn’t there today and part of him was worried that something had happened to him, but he put off the thought of worst outcomes and still decided to take his coffee straight. He sat at the window seat and leaned his bony shoulder against the potted ___ that was sandwiched between two ___ on the sill. The thing about the window seat where the plants were was that this was also where there were gnats, and this cafe for some reason was infested. Max couldn’t be sure, but he started to develop the overwhelming feeling that he had contracted a family of fleas that were doing the waltz on the back of his neck with a pirouette down his spine.\n“Am I paranoid or,” he had said to Herb one day. “Or is this a bug bite?”\n“Oh, God!”\n“What, what, get it off!”\n“You got a real eager bugger of a pimple.”\n“Herb, Jesus.”\n“I almost—”"

The application, he imagined, like getting choked up or being unable to speak words to a pretty girl. But that was back in elementary school, and he’d grown hard of heart since then.

    "text": "“Why was Sara always such a hard ass towards me?”\nMaddie brought her hand up to her mouth and turned her face to the writers’ wall to hide her laugh. They were standing at the water bubbler (which Max liked to call the watering hole in this hole in the wall of a cafe), and Maddie had just finished putting her card back into her wallet when she looked up (saw him seeing her).\n“Well hello to you too, Maximilian.”\n“Hey, sorry, I’ve been keeping that in for some years, but I’ve genuinely always wondered.”\n“Did you not know?”\n“No, know what?”\n“Sara had like the hugest crush on you.”\n“What?”\n“Big time.”\n“I had no clue,” he said, holding back. “I had the biggest crush on you.”\n“You did?”\n“Yeah. I thought it was so obvious, I mean—”\n“It wasn’t obvious to me.”\n“I wish I’d told you then.”\n“Why, so we could’ve held hands on the way to fifth period?”\n“No.”\n“We were just kids.”\n“It was high school.”\n“Big kids. Plus, I wouldn’t have done that to Sara. I wanted to be a good friend. I think that’s just what any of us wants.”\n“I heard about her and Oliver.”\n“Yeah.”\n“I’m sorry, that’s pretty shitty…of the both of them…but especially her…I’m guessing you’re not that great of friends anymore?”\n“Pretty much.”\nMax looked at her. She wasn’t just pretty.\n“Every day for six years I wanted to tell you how beautiful you are.”\n“Max, thanks.”\n“It’s true.”\n“My—”\n“I think people should go after what they want, full force.”\n“It’s not always that simple.”\n“Of course it is. Life’s short.”\n“My boyfriend’s actually meeting me here,” she said, turning towards the street to pluck him from the crowd of passers-by and people in line. “I think you’d love him.”\n“I’m actually meeting someone here too.”\n“Oh.”\n“Yeah, I mean maybe we could—”\n“Totally, I mean we wouldn’t want to interrupt but we’ll totally come say hi, maybe sit for a second.”\n“For sure,” he said, looking around. There was maybe one free table.\n“If there’s somewhere to seat, at least.”\n“Sounds good, so what have you been up to?”\n“Besides spending my life savings on coffee shops?”\n“Naturally.”\nMaddie liked to perform a degree of poverty. She wasn’t as rich as Sara, whose forefathers’ surname could be seen engraved along the steps leading up to the Impressionists (swing a left at the top and go straight), but Maddie was well off. Her parents had a second home in Cape Cod (which she always referred to as the Cape, and reminded people that the correct preposition was on, not in), and she lived in a brownstone on 83rd between 3rd and Lexington, but her parents’ pipe dream was this one stretch between Park and Madison Avenue. Hence, her name.\n“Oh, I see him.”\n“Awesome, actually I have to pee,” he said, immediately regretting it. “I’ll stop by your table.”\nMax had no plan to stop by the table, but he said it. If he had it his way, he would’ve holed up in that godforsaken restroom until closing. There was always piss on the ground, but the grafitti and poetry on the walls could keep him busy for a few hours. Of course, he wouldn’t do that. He wasn’t crazy. As he loitered at the toilet seat, he couldn’t help but think what Maddie meant by it (how she wouldn’t have done that to Sara. What was that? Had she liked him too? Did she still? Was there still hope). See, Max didn’t actually need to pee. In fact, he hadn’t even been thirsty. He had seen Maddie standing in line, and he’d seen her walk in, up to the counter, and point to the cherry and cheese danish, and he had timed it perfectly even though the timing was off. She was always in a relationship with some guy from a happy family."

I’d wear my superman sneakers and think the S shield was my life force. I’d pick up every possible walking stick and pretend I was an old man. You told me the difference between right and wrong, the madrone and manzanita, and for so long I couldn’t see it.\nWe were living just outside of town then and Muir Woods was our backyard, the three of us. At age five, I learned how to ride a bike because you taught me. I was scared at first of falling off, but you called me a natural and all of a sudden I was ready for two wheels. You told me not to worry, as long as I had my helmet on and eyes open, I’d be safe. I remember one day on our walk I told you my superpower was knowing exactly what mom needs but I wish it could be flying like the ducks in front of us. We were sitting on a bench by Phoenix Lake, sharing a bag of orange slices, and you said your superpower was protecting water. I remember being confused by that. I didn’t know what you meant by it.\nMom asked if I wanted to go on a walk to the lake with her yesterday, but I wanted to go alone so I said no and then snuck out later without telling her. I felt bad, but sometimes being around her is like a sad reminder, and I just want to talk to my father. I hate that I sometimes refer to you as father. I wish you had wanted to talk too, Dad. I wish I had asked you more questions, like why water, or knew what you were going through. But I understand, and I’m piecing it together even if I can’t remember or don’t know everything. I hope you’re proud of the young man I’m becoming. I miss you. Mom misses you. We both wish you were here.\nLove,\nEthan"

Is it possible just to be, the luckiest unlucky person, or not to be? Now I see a perfectly clean seat to sit on, and have the opportunity to write whilst I wait. It’s my first time sitting on a subway platform bench, in all the (seven) years I’ve lived in this inspiring, (only slightly) dirty city, and the F train is rocking into the 57th Street station as I think of all the years we’ve called each other friends. Part of me wonders how in the world thirteen minutes have passed, and I’ve only managed to pen this much on the back of a postcard. I feel like the woman in the painting, who reminded me of you, deep in thought, with books on the table in front of her, I’m sure, a writing utensil in her right hand, and an infinite number of ideas in her head. She’s very fashionably dressed. Her green scarf reminds me of the denim skirt you wore, and polka-dotted long-sleeve henley, when we met up at the MET earlier this spring. This book I hope will offer you something along your creative path. I look forward to reading what you write, and one day seeing your name on a book cover, in the store of some independent bookseller on the lower east side of Manhattan, like Sweet Pickle Books, or McNally Jackson on Fulton. Rooting for you, and in your corner—always. Happy birthday, and summer solstice.\nLove,\nElizabeth Kolling"

Like, maybe he’s comparing his stepmother to the other ones he sees around him in his social circle.”\n“On that point, did you hear about Cole’s parents?”\n“No.”\n“They’re getting divorced.”\n“Oh.”\n“Yeah, apparently the dad cheated on the mom.”\n“You know, I’m not totally against divorce if it means that each person can be happier.”\n“But look what it does to the kids involved,” said Ethan. “I mean, Cole’s kind of an asshole.”\n“Yeah, the behavioral issues.”\n“Any way, sorry, I keep talking about anything else but this book.”\n“No that’s okay.”\n“What else?”\n“Another thing that I was thinking about was the emphasis on June 21, ‘the longest day of the year in our hemisphere.’\n“Summer solstice, right?”\n“Yeah, and then the mention that ‘it was so light too…’”\n“Okay.”\n“It made me think of the reference to Iceland a few chapters earlier, and wonder is this Ishmael is a man who is really just a boy with trauma on the inside and a cruel mother figure, maybe why he’s such a loner and fearful of intimacy, sharing a bed and whatnot with Queequeg, or is Ishmael just exaggerating the whole bedtime situation, and this is a cared-for kid who comes from privilege, who’s a picky eater and didn’t want to have his bedtime.”\n“Alway refusing bedtime…seems to me our Ishmael hasn’t changed much.”\n“And how is Ishmael so worldly, like why mention Iceland unless he’s been to Iceland. So, this coupled with the fact that the day is super long and there’s this emphasis on the shining sun, and his mother or stepmother or whatever putting him to bed despite it being light out, it makes me think that he’s on a family vacation in Iceland and having a kid fit.”\n“Sorry, I don’t really get the whole point about….where does Iceland fit in again?”\n“In summer, Iceland only experiences a limited number of hours of darkness. The days are like super long, like the sun only sets for less than an hour or something. I think it’s called midnight sun.”\n“Interesting.”\n“Any way, I’m just spit-balling.”\n“No, by all means.”\n“Also, the mention of ‘our’ when he refers to hemisphere. I thought he was thinking of the hemispheres that Iceland and the U.S. share, instead of like the royal We.”\n“Hmm, interesting,” said Ethan. “I thought the whole scene where the hand reached out for his, or was already just holding his hand. I thought it was this moment of spiritual awakening.”\n“The hand of God.”\n“Maybe he wasn’t in Iceland or America. Maybe it was heaven. Maybe foreshadowing.”\n“Maybe he dies in the end.”\n“Very how do you say, human of him.”"

    "text": "Sundays were for popovers, a family recipe passed down from Nana and Papa on Ethan’s mother’s side.\nLaura would creep downstairs in the early morning, as a force of habit. She’d go first into the kitchen and then carry an ice cube into the bathroom. She’d stand in front of the mirror, look at the fine lines and carve the freezing feeling like a slab across her face, from her lower cheekbone to her forehead. She’d close her eyes, and bring it over her lids, but the beep-beep-beeping would bring her back to earth. Soon enough, every time. She’d brace the edge of the sink, bow her head and inhale deeply before slamming the freezer shut. She was out of body, sometimes. No matter how many times she tried for closure, she’d always fail to close the door completely, and it would start again.\nBeep, beep, beep.\nWith a beet-red face, she’d take out the eggs and the milk, pasture-raised, and place them on the counter, next to the butter and flour from Saturday. It was gold Calacatta marble, imported from Italy (Carrara), and she’d made a mornay sauce with Don the night before. The pasta was fusilli, the twisty kind. There he was at her front door, dorky-looking, his veins protruding from strong arms that had hugged her goodbye.\n“Come over,” he had said. “I’ll cook for you next time.”\n“I’d love that,” she said back, leaning against the frame. “Saturday?”\n“Saturday.”\nHe had said it with a smile as he started to walk backwards (a few lingering glances) towards the cul-de-sac, and everything was calculated in the mind of Laura. She’d use about eight tablespoons for the mashed potatoes, emulsified for texture, and cut a slab for the table, leaving about six tablespoons, just enough to double the recipe and bring a few to Edith who was 92 years old and had no next of kin next door. Laura didn’t like to be left alone and Ethan tended to spend Saturday nights with friends or Samantha, so she’d call up Levi’s father.\n“Hi, Don.”\n“Laura…”\n“So,” she’d say. “I have a whole bunch of heirloom potatoes that I just picked up from the farm stand, and…I was thinking…the boys are going to that party tonight…so…would you like to come over for dinner?”\n“I don’t know, I was just going to have a late lunch.”\n“Can’t start skipping dinner, now Don.”\nHe didn’t want to say yes, but he couldn’t say no.\n“Dinner sounds good.”\n“How’s seven, or six?”\n“Six works,” he said.\n“How about this,” she said. “We’ll make it together to buy you some time, build up an appetite, and we’ll eat later.”\n“Laura, you know I’m a bull in a china shop when it comes to the kitchen.”\n“I can show you how to use a cutting board.”\n“What can I bring?”\n“Nothing,” she said. “You can bring yourself.”\nLaura was flirting with him, and Don knew it."

She has some great ideas about how you can make your applications more competitive. Any way, I know it’s the weekend. I’m just so happy how it turned out, people really seemed to be enjoying themselves.

I was putting out small fires everywhere, and I hardly got to stop for a slice of watermelon.”\n“Mom,” he said. “I don’t want to fight with you. I’m not trying to corner you.

It’s not easy on my own now, and it’d be nice to receive some appreciation once in a while.”\n“Don’t bring Dad into this.”\n“I’ll go to your girlfriend’s play,” she said. “Happy?”"

The path itself led nowhere waterward, though the pond was just there. Couples rowed their boats, unawares, and Max watched the turtle pick up pace as a little girl wobbled speedily towards it, with those little legs not moving fast enough for the reach of her outstretched hands. She wanted to pet the turtle and take it home, but before she could pick it up she heard a bellowing Hey!\nMax turned to see where the abrasive scream came from; it was a Central Park ranger in a golf cart, speeding down the west-side loop.\n“Leave him alone!” said the Central Park ranger, putting the cart in park. “He’s trying to get home.”\nThe little girl stood back, and they both watched as the turtle headed straight for the fencing but struggled to pass through. The turtle was stuck, and the little girl covered her eyes as it tried with all its might to move backwards. The turtle tried again as Max turned his head to look for a moment at the Central Park ranger.\nHe didn’t care what he’d said about not interfering or whether he was breaking someone else’s made-up rules. He walked towards the turtle, and freed it from the metal fencing. He saw blood where the metal had scraped the shell, and the turtle disappeared downhill towards the pond, into the foliage. The Central Park ranger nodded at Max, and took off.\n“Thank you,” said the little girl with a tilt of the head. “Why are you so skinny?”\n“I’m a turtle,” he said. “I only eat leafy greens.”\n“You’re not a turtle.”"

He’d wear it, ivory and tweed, every other day-before-Christmas Eve, even though Laura called it her “Winter Solstice” party. Laura would throw a big party each year during the holidays and invite all of Ethan’s friends and their families. There’d be charcuterie boards but in weird places, which always seemed to coincide with some home improvement that finally completed the house and that Laura was very excited to tell people about, so finding the food was somewhat of a hunt and always a source of gossip on drives home. For instance, one year, Laura put a charcuterie board out on the back deck despite the bitter cold weather they were having, as a way of leading guests to the new landscaping. It was all native species, and drought resistant.\n“I just want to do my part,” she said. “In times like these.”\nThis year, she put the charcuterie board upstairs in the old guest room that she’d recently converted into an art studio. She paid someone to do it, but it took months beyond the original quote and the whole thing was a nightmare. By the time winter solstice passed and the party came around, the room consisted of blank canvases despite a bunch of brushes that’d clearly been used. The paint was dry, still coating the bristles.\n“I just love it,” she said to the Townsend family who stood at the doorway, careful not to enter. “It’s a dream, you know…my very own easel.”\nLaura walked further into the recesses of the room and glided her palm across the stool, making her way towards the window.\n“Sitting on this seat, watching the sun rise.”\nThere was one painting: a four by four of the color green, centimeters thick and projecting from the canvas, with a single patch of blue left of center. She titled it, “Pubbenivasanussati,” which she translated for the Townsends as “the remembrance of former births.”\nThe death of his wife is what changed the holidays for him. Grandpa C. would pack into his little Volvo and drive the eight hours or so straight from Brentwood, CA, the last nice part of Los Angeles, or the City of no more Angels, as he’d refer to Home in his old age. He’d stay for as long as it took him to re-connect with his grandson, regain feeling in his legs, or finish off the Humboldt Fog. He swore by it—cheese on a cracker, eating standing, walking as a lifestyle, and saw driving the scenic route as the only exception for sitting idle."

    "text": "Dear —,\n“Keep your cool,” a wise woman once said…\n…It was Thursday work from home, and I had decided to take my lunch break at Birch Coffee (on 88th between 3rd and Lexington) before afternoon meetings—for a bit of calmness and reading.\nThere was high demand at the late morning hour, so I stood in line while looking innocently out the window. I saw that both picnic tables were occupied, but there was still enough space at the one with the woman. There were two men and another woman who appeared to be the girlfriend (and much more) of one of them, who was just about to leave, sitting at the picnic table on the right. Everyone had computers, so much in common, and some ice left over as Rayn greeted me at the counter. She asked for my order.\n[Dialogue is not direct quotation]\n“Is it…Liz?”\n“Haha, good memory!” I said. “Technically it’s Elizabeth, but yes, you can put down Liz. It’s easier.”\nI saw her proceed to write down Elizabeth, and I felt bad for how much longer than Liz the name was.\n“What’s your name?”\n“Rayn,” she said.\n“Ah, Rain?! One of my middle names is Rain.”\n“Oo wow, I love that!”\n“R-A-I-N?”\n“R-A-Y-N, actually.”\n“Oo I love that spelling,” I said. “What does it mean?”\n“Heaven’s door, I think.”\nI opened up Moby Dick and handed her the punch card (not quite an accurate bookmark; I stick it randomly somewhere towards the ending, which I haven’t reached yet).\n“Oo,” said Rayn. “Next one’s on us.”\n“Oo, exciting,” I said, wondering whether that’s a good or bad thing, since it means I’ve been drinking a good amount of coffee lately. Going to Birch, I guess, has become part of my routine—I go there whenever I want to read a chapter.\n[Which reminds me] I said:\n“Do you mind if I sit?”\nThe woman at the picnic table gave me no answer (“NA”), so I just shrugged my shoulders and looked around to see if anyone else had witnessed the embarrassing Q&NA. No one cared what I was doing, of course. I sat down and started The Ship. I read for a few minutes and then turned to see if my cappucino was ready. Through the window I could see a little teacup and saucer on the counter, so I got up ad went back inside retrieve it. I thanked the male barista who had made it and said hi to Alicia who greeted me with an enthusiasm that felt sincere. I added a dollop of honey that was supposed to be an elegant drizzle around the art. I walked back in a balancing act to picnic table. I sipped once for some strength and then mixed in the sweetness. Every time, I seem to sing “You’re So Vain” to myself. I think everything is set just right, with “clouds in my coffee,” and my palm wrapped around something warm (It makes me feel warm inside. And with a good book to read? How lucky am I?).\nSo, I sat there, sipping, reading, blissfully unawares, and all of a sudden the woman across the table started screaming. More specifically, she started yelling at the men at the other table.\n“Jesus, can you stop talking so loudly!”\n“We’re outside,” one of them said. “We’re in public.”\n“In America, people don’t take calls on speaker phone.”\nAt this point, I had looked up from the page and turned straight ahead after making one quick glance at the woman who had erupted in the middle of everyone’s morning coffee. Her AirPods were out, and she was ugly. With those big, round eyes (blue) and that alopecia, she kind of resembled Gollum. But call her Karen.\n“We are American,” said the man.\nThe woman didn’t respond. She looked at me, because she must’ve thought I was on her side. She gave a gross sigh that sounded like she had mucus in her throat that she wanted out of there.\n“Uccccgh.”\nShe rolled her big, round eyes (blue) and put her AirPods in. She returned to her computer (equilibrium) again, hunched over.\nAfter a few deafening minutes, the men got up from the tables but left their computers. I tried to return to Moby Dick, but I couldn’t get over what had just occurred. I also didn’t entirely know what had just occurred. I had been reading, after all, and everything becomes white noise when I am reading. I didn’t even register that the man was on the phone behind me or talking loudly in the first place. I thought maybe I had heard some Farsi. Maybe the man had said something that upset her. So I said hi to her.\n“Hi,” I said to her. “I just wanted to ask what it was that they were talking about?”\n“Oh, I don’t know,” she said.\n“Did they say something that upset you?”\n“No, they were just on the phone talking super loudly, on speaker phone.”\n“Huh, I mean, it is a public space, so they’re allowed to do that, no?”\n“No, they’re not. They’re just these douchey guys. Look at them. They clearly don’t live here.”\nI turned to look where she was nodding her eyes towards. The two men were on the sidewalk. One was on the phone. They were well dressed. They had a sort of swagger. I would call them tall, dark, handsome. I didn’t think this was evidence against them, and I turned back to face the woman.\n“Sorry, but I think that’s kind of judgmental.”\n“They’re talking loudly on the phone in some other language.”\n“Asking them to speak more quietly is one thing. Especially if you’re nice about it. But it’s upsetting to me and I’m sure them that in tandem with that ask you accuse them of not being from America.”\n“They sure don’t look or sound like it.”\n“Seriously, lady, are you racist? Xenophobic? It’s not okay.”\n“You don’t take a professional work call in public and put it on speaker phone. I’m working here too, and it’s very disruptive.”\n“If you wanted peace and quiet, you maybe shouldn’t have opted for a hot spot at a coffee shop or a picnic table on a busy street, and—”\n“I don’t know what kind of Gen Z speech you’re about to give me, but—”\n“Uh, I don’t identify with Gen Z, but thank you.”\n“You’re clearly Gen Z.”\n“Okay, Karen.”\n“Karen! Uh! See! You are Gen Z.”\n“Respectfully, you’re a Karen, and I think you’re crazy.”\n“Are you even from here?”\n“No, I’m not from here.”\n“Then you should leave.”\n“I really hope you find peace. It appears to me that you are deeply troubled or going through something. So, I’m sorry for you, and I really hope you find peace with yourself.”\nThat was my last word. I put my book in my bag and carried my empty cup inside. By the time I placed the saucer on the counter (where Alicia and the male barista were debriefing about something), my composure cracked. I suddenly felt myself physically shaken and the welling start as I tried to warn the staff about this woman and tell them what had just happened out there.\n“I’m sorry,” I said. “I don’t know why I’m crying. It’s just…it was really upsetting to me…it’s really upsetting to me, especially now.”\nThe male barista (whose name I don’t know) leaned towards the window to look out at the woman whow was still there, hunched over her computer.\n“I don’t recognize her,” he said. “I don’t even think she’s drinking our coffee.”\n“I don’t know if she’s a regular, but I just thought you should know.”\n“Thank you, thank you for telling us.”\n“We’ll talk to the two men. They’re regulars…and ask them about it.”\n“I tried to talk to her about it, but I don’t know what this woman’s deal is. I couldn’t get through to her. I don’t know, she may have mental health issues. Either that or she’s just entitled and very rude.\n“Definitely racist,” said the male barista.\n“Classic Upper East Side,” said Alicia.\nI had learned Alicia’s name this past Saturday, and I’d asked her whether she was writing that other (early) morning when I saw her with her computer at one of the picnic tables. She smiled and laughed, before clarifying.\n“Oh, no, that was just me working on the schedule,” she had said. “I’m the manager.”\nI was not expecting the turn of events today. I tried to stick up for what I thought was right, and ultimately I was pretty floored by the interaction. I must admit, I was a little sassy with some of my remarks and some definitely weren’t as diplomatic as they could have been. But I tried. I don’t try to intellectualize why I cry sometimes. Hormones, maybe? I’ve always been a sensitive person. It’s my superpower and kryptonite, and has been since I was a little girl. Beyond this, there are also a lot of things going on in my life which I haven’t had any more tears for recently and maybe these tears today were those manifesting. Sometimes I’m like the New York sky in summer, in need of an exhale after the unfortunate weather we’ve been having.\nSitting now again at my desk and monitor, I look out the window and see it’s raining hard outside. There’s also a spotted lantern fly holding onto the screen, and I’ve stomped on only a few over the years. They always manage to fly free at the last moment, prior to toes down. Calm before the storm? Maybe the storm is before the calm. Maybe the woman was going through something and taking it out on others is her cry for help. Maybe she’s just an ugly person who lacks humanity. All I know is…if you can’t keep your cool while drinking a seven-dollar cold brew, then I can’t help you.\nLove,\nElizabeth Kolling"

    "text": "Dear —,\nI have my traditions—rites of reflection. I walk Division Street each Sunday and turn left on Orchard, with the same destination in mind: Son Del North. The one and only burrito worth condsidering in New York City. I get the carne asada (caramelized onions, pinto beans, cheese, a grilled tortilla, comes with salsa verde).\nOn a sunny day, I’d have taken my bliss to Elizabeth Street Garden for eating followed by reading. However, today was drizzly and I didn’t end up getting a burrito. Here’s why: From Stanton Street, I could see a crowd out front, blocking the sidewalk and pouring out into the middle of the street. I walked up to a woman who had a burrito in her hand with some bites missing and asked what the situation was.\n“How long for a burrito, and why so many people?”\nIt took a few attempts to hear her, but she told me that today was the Pedro Pascal lookalike contest.\n“You know, the actor.”\n“Oh, okay, thanks,” I said, not sure what that had to do with Son Del North or what it meant for my burrito prospects. I weaved further into the compact crowd, without seeing much resemblance, and approached a man in a white uniform. My guess was that he worked for Son Del North, which has a white facade, but another man got to him first. He asked the question that I would’ve asked:\n“How do I order a burrito?”\nThe man in white looked down at the sidewalk to think for a second.\n“Uh, we’ll be open in 20 minutes.”\nI was confused; How could the kitchen be closed with all these people around eating burritos. They had to have ordered them, some way, somehow, which meant the place had to have been open and operating. Was it all of a sudden closed for some reason? I didn’t want to ask questions or get to the bottom of it. As people, we must pick our battles and so I walked on. I did look back though, before I reached E Houston Street. I saw that the man who had interjected was walking in the same direction. Both of us, at a (temporary) loss. No burrito today, but that’s okay. I had some delicuous Borscht, and potato and cheese dumplings, in Ukrainian Village.\nAfterwards, I planned to take the yellow line home. However, there was caution tape tied to the entrance and the posted sign said the R/W trains weren’t servicing the 8th St-NYU station, same as the past few weekends. So, I walked on towards West 4th (along Greenwich Avenue), which is where a full circle moment came into play.\nAs I walked, I sent a text inquiring about dinner. I offered to pick up some slices from Mama’s Too (which specializes in the square, but is my favorite for its triangular slice with pepperoni, vodka sauce, parmesan and basil (I believe)). Point is, this was a time-sensitive text. I was almsot at 6th Ave, after all, and I could either (1) go straight to the nearby subway or (2) presume every person wants pizza for dinner and go straight for the slices. I don’t like to presume, so I started to slow my roll. I walked at a snail’s pace, stopping a few times to loiter in front of quiet residences. I stopped outside Goods for the Study and looked into the store through the window. I saw the pens and the notebooks they sold, which looked nice. I thought maybe I could go in and buy some more time without actually buying anything while I waited for this special person to respond to my text.\nThen, all of a sudden, relief. A ding. Pizza, as it were. I started to respond at the spot, and I turned left to face the street (for some reason). That’s when I saw the face of a man who I recognized. This man looked too familiar for me not to stop him with a hey.\n“Hi,” he said.\n“I think we were…” I said.\n“I’m really in a rush,” he said.\n“Can I walk with you?”\nHe didn’t say yes but he didn’t say no. He sort of just shrugged, as if to say okay that should be fine.\nSo, I walked with him and tried to talk to him as if he were just a person (which I am convinced of, of course).\n“A few years ago, I was on a plane ride to San Francisco with you,” I said.\n“Woah, really? I haven’t been there in years. When was that?”\n“2018? 2019? 2021? I have no clue,” I said.\n“Huh.”\n“We were on the same plane ride, and I regretted not slipping you a piece of paper with my friend’s name on it. She’s a singer-songwriter, and I wanted to give her a plug.”\nAt this point, we were both stopped just before 6th Avenue, and he had turned to face me.\n“On Spotify? What’s her name?”\n“Yeah, Spotify,” I said as he pulled out his phone. “Rebecca McCartney.”\nHe typed in her name, tapped on her top song, Close to Me, and it played as he held out his phone.\n“Her?”\n“Yes, her.”\n“What songs?”\nI recommended my favorites as he scrolled through her discography.\n“They’re all good, give her a listen,” I said, and we parted ways.\nThe man on the street was Jack Antonoff, and I’ve been thinking about this interaction for the past few hours since it happened. The Universe kind of, sort of, gives you little gifts like these. For years since it happened, I’ve thought back on the flight to SFO when I saw him sitting in first class and recognized him then only to fail in telling him about my friend. I felt like I had failed her or lost her a career opportunity. I want for her to succeed like he has in the music industry, and I gave myself a hard time for not having the courage then to slip him a piece of paper with a note. And then today, years later, at about 5:11 pm (phone call to Rebecca time stamp), becuase of timing and a semi-broken subway system, I crossed paths with this music producer again. I was able to tell him about her, as I had originally intended. That feels good.\nIt’s also a wonder what leaves your mind when you meet a person who has been so successful at the thing that you or someone you know aspires to. The mystique takes over. For me, the word flight fell away from my vocabulary, and I ended up saying plane ride at least twice during the conversation. I thought that was funny.\nLove,\nElizabeth Kolling"

    "text": "Dear —,\nThere are few things I can stand a line for: a little Faith after the week we’ve been having, I think. And what would Ishmael do?\nI almost didn’t do it, but I did. I walked through Central Park and took a breath and rest on a bench that looked northwest towards a hill. Fathers and sons were playing frisbee on the flat, before the slope. Someone lay on a rock (Manhattan (mica) schist).\n“I can’t stand it,” we once said. “The system is so broken.”\nWe were saying it again, and after a bit I took my earphones out; I stood up to start walking again. I passed the MET. I passed Neue, where there was a line wrapped as usual around the corner, and I wondered whether the Galerie had moved its first free Friday of the month to the second week given that last Friday was the Fourth. July’s already going by fast, and I passed the stark white (the colossal Utahraptor-esque Guggenheim, that is). I think I’m numb to it. East 90th Street was just ahead, and I looked across to catch the light.\nI passed the Church of the Heavenly Rest. There was a line up the block, and a big sign that said “Candlelight.” I was curious, a few steps past it, and I figured a mysterious event at a church may help me heal something so I turned around. I was wearing all black and sweating in my denim jeans and high-collared short-sleeve shirt, though no one knew why. All these people in summer dresses and shorts knew what was happening inside, and had made plans. Meanwhile, I started to realize the tickets were presale only as people started to prepare their QR codes. Perfect, and too good to be true, as it were. Still, I thought I may stand an off-chance of buying at the door so I stayed in line and inched forward with the rest. Eventually, I looked up at the arched entrance.\nThey shall come from the east and the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.\nThe nice young man said technically the 6:30 (p.m.) show was sold out but this one was on him.\n“Really?” I asked. He said yes, to walk up the stairs and ask for section C.\nThere was no ash box to trip over, but there were candles lining the stairwell. I took a seat for free and proceeded to listen to a beautiful string quartet concert.\nI tried to read the other side when I exited (ended up taking a picture to decipher later), and this sort of happenstance and opportunituy is what I love about New York City.\nThere is one body and one Spirit, even as we are called in one hope of your calling. One Lord. One Faith. One Baptism. One God and Father of all who is above all, and through all, and in you all.\nIn terms of word choice, I would’ve punctuated the sentence with another word (always, instead of all). On the way home, I stubbed my shoe on a piece of uplifted concrete and now my toe hurts. Ah, well. Life’s what happens when you’re making other plans. All’s well that ends well. Que sera sera.\nLove,\nElizabeth Kolling"

    "text": "Dear —,\nHigh Street always leads to Fulton. I should have known, and I had had my fill.\n“Boring Hill,” said a Rohan (not Rowan) of London outside Public Records afterwards. I had had hours to kill earlier, emerging from the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station.\nI follow my passion where I can. Sometimes that means an A train after work, 45 minutes downtown and east to somewhere unbeknown (to me) in Brooklyn. The literary networking event wasn’t starting until 8, it was still before six, and I had at least an hour and a half before I was meant to meet a new acquaintance (acquainted because we both chronically go to the same cafe (can be found at the bar, on our high chairs, tap tap tapping away at McNally Jackson)).\n“Are you a writer?” I had asked a number of weeks ago.\n“Yes…”\nA literary connection! I gave the MFA student my email, and he insisted that he’d send some of what he’s written. I never promised to do the same (too personal). I’ve never liked sharing what I’m writing. I have an ego when it comes to my ideas. They’re pure genius, and other writers are vultures (I’m being facetious but there is some sincerity to this feeling). Plus, they are works in progress and some of my writing is not good. Any way, this was weeks before a very special person with a PhD helped me code a website for my writing. He asked what icon and color scheme I wanted. I liked the lone rose with a tall stem and sparse leaves, and I like the color pink (because, it’s girly). Any way, weeks later, the MFA student had invited me to a literary event.\n“My friend can’t go, and I have an extra ticket,” he had said (dialogue is not verbatim). “It’ll be good for networking.”\nHis professors and peers would be there. That sounded good to me, as someone on the outside.\n“There’s this biweekly writer’s group I go to (I’ve been once), and one is on Wednesday, but send me the info and I’ll let you know.”\n“Okay, but let me know, or I’ll ask someone else.”\nIn everything there is opportunity cost. I’ve never been a networker (it’s icky and weird to me to pursue a connection with some ulterior, self-aggrandizing motive or to some aim, and asking for a job doesn’t scream merit-based to me. Leeching off of other people isn’t any way to make it in this world, at least for me. Then again, maybe I just don’t know how to ask for what I want). I want community, and friends with similar interests. I’ve never taken a creative writing class. I know no professors who may be able to write me a recommendation (I do know a film professor who is a little pretentious and has recommended that I not apply to fellowships before (I applied any way, and didn’t get in)), and for every application it seems you need at least two or three. So, the opinion of others does matter and maybe networking is just meeting people. I do like meeting people, and I think I’m good at it (I learned that from someone). The more the merrier.\nAny way, I don’t like committments (I can only name one). He didn’t send me much info about it, but I ultimately decided to give up going to the writer’s group and instead go to the mysterious literary event. Who knows, maybe a book deal would come of it.\nAs my grandmother used to say, “Life is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be lived.” (Popular quote, not sure who to credit)\nSo, there I was, walking down Bond Street, unknowingly in the direction of Cafe Kitsumé. It looked like a nice place to sit and read for the next hour or so, so I approached the door. This is when I saw the hours posted. Closing time was six, so that left me 16 minutes of potential bliss. Not worth it. I pulled up Maps and searched cafes. I saw I was in a place called Boerum Hill, which I knew was where my friend Mia moved to. I hold her dear even though she hasn’t invited me over to cook dinner (hehe), and I wondered what Mia was up to. I almost sent her a text, but I didn’t. Cafes was not the search, so I searched coffee shops. Perfect, one nearby that closes at seven. That would give me a good, dedicated hour to reading. I turned around and started walking northwest to it. Upon approach, an employee was out front collapsing chairs. It was 5:57 pm and the space was empty.\n“Are you still open?”\n“Uh, no, we’re closing, we close at six, but we could make you a drink to go.”\n(Basically) I don’t care for coffee or expensive iced teas. I’m interested in third spaces for the sake of them, to sit and read or write in a place with good feng shui. I said, “Oh, that’s okay, thank you,” and loitered outside a Cuban restaurant to scheme a spot. I stood there thinking and then without direction turned around and started walking the way I came. One facade did catch my eye, and I peeled off to read the menu. Mediterranean (no, not whalers). There was a burger (a few) on the menu, and an old woman bent at a 90-degree angle brushed slowly beside me and pushed the door open. I continued to investigate the menu, while subtly aware of her standing just on the other side of the door. I opened it, and squeezed past her as the hostess greeted me.\n“I’ll be with you in one second.” she said.\nThis old woman and I were side by side, and she came back a few minutes later to seat me….I chose a seat at the bar, and I read the Chowder chapter and asked for a burger (medium-rare).\n“It comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion, would you like to add blue cheese or cheddar cheese or goat cheese or bacon?”\n“Ooo, could I hold the tomato and hmmmm, I usually go blue, but goat cheese sounds good.”\n“Goat cheese is my go-to.”\n“Let’s do goat cheese.”\n“You got it.”\nI asked for the check and walked to the top of the block to meet the MFA student. At Grand Army, I didn’t order a drink. The man behind the bar had on a white t-shirt with a Krabby Patty and Spongebog, and square pants. Tattoos were on his arms, which were long enough to reach over the counter to the edge of the bar, where my tall glass of water was nearing empty.\n“Nice reach!” I said.\n“Thanks,” he said and turned to fill another’s.\n“Square sponge Bob,” I remembered a wise woman say once, and I was thinking of —\nI told the MFA student that it was 8:04 pm, and we left. Walking down Bond Street, I brought up my boyfriend as I have before.\n“Oh, I quit distance back in college,” he said.\n“Wasn’t for you?”\n“No, not at all, total nightmare, wouldn’t wish it on anyone.”\n“I think it depends on the person,” I said. “Whether or not the relationship is important enough to you both.”\n“I guess.”\n“This is my first long distance relationship,” I said. “It’s my first relationship, actually, and I hope my last.”\n“Oh, so you were a party girl in college.”\n“No,” I said, censoring a stronger rebuke (internally rolling my eyes at the suggestion). “Quite the opposite, and I never met anyone deserving.”\n“Okay, ego.”\n“I mean, I never met anyone who I wanted to be in a relationship with until I did. I was never interested in being in a relationship for the sake of it, and I have standards.”\nUltimately, I felt a little duped. It wasn’t a literary event for networking as it had been represented to me, not really. It was kind of like going to the club, loud, dark, with people holding cocktails in their hands, which I couldn’t care less about. I started talking to someone who worked in marketing for a B2B software company.\n“Stripe?” I asked.\n“No,” he said. “Have you heard of Rippling?”\n“Yes! I see their ads everywhere. So, that’s you.”\n“That’s me, I guess.”\nThis man was the plus one of the man next to him who had just slipped away to the bar. He introduced his boyfriend as a self-proclaimed poet.\n“So cool,” I said.\nThe poet came back with a sparkling Yerba mate, and the MFA student made his way over. We cheersed (I with my pantomiming hand around an imaginary beverage) and all talked for a bit.\n“So, what do you do?”\n“I like to write,” I said. “I actually just created a website. My boyfriend helped me make it.”\n“Oh, cool!”\n“I’ve been thinking of it as my very own MFA (self-funded).”\n“Okay.”\n“It’s a form of structure, and I guess external accountability. It helps me write every day, or at least most days. Just to not think about what I’m writing, not care whether it’s so edited,” I said. “So, I just write and push it up to the ether. Every post is in support of an idea I have for a character. I’m basically developing a universe of characters who are all connected in some way, and eventually they’ll all converge in one way or another. It’s really fun for me.”\nI wasn’t confident that the self-proclaimed poet could hear a thing I said. I also hate talking about it. It’s such a bore (don’t talk about it, just do it, get it done already, hit ’em with the link, or let it speak for itself).\n“So, have you found your community?”\n“Me?”\n“Yeah,” the self-proclaimed poet said to me. I had also started to space out. Other things were on my mind, like how maybe things are built to be broken.\n“I don’t know,” I said. “Maybe, I mean, writing has always been a very solitary activity for me. It still is.”\nWe released one another to the rest of the room. The MFA student told me he saw none of his professors and none of his fellow MFAs. That made complete sense to me, and the reality of the evening was sinking in.\nThe literary event was a party at Public Records, where I’d been once before, on April 1, 2023 (Fools’ day), which has left an indelible mark on me and also not even close to one at the same time.\nI was ready to leave, so I cut loose after a conversation with a writer based in Red Hook that I could only half-hear came to a natural end. The MFA student saw someone he knew, and he b-lined it for her. This was a blessing (no offense) and my opportunity to save my ears and get the heck out of there. So, I did just that, having been there for at most a half hour. I made my mad dash out of the place. As I was reaching the point of starting to think less about leaving and more about walking to the station, I looked up to see that none other than Mia (!!!) was walking towards me.\n“Ah!” we both exclaimed, surprised and happy to see each other.\nShe was on her way to the event herself just as I was on my out?? What a miracle, and another gift from the universe. A guy who I would learn was from London and named Rohan with an H instead of a W walked up to her and she greeted him. She introduced us, and we three spoke for a while as a man knelt on the pavement beside us in a sea of cans, sorting.\n“Oh, a high school friend…” Rohan said (a bit impressed?).\n(We go way back)\n“How was it?” Mia asked.\n“Super loud,” I said. “So wear your earplugs.”\nMy favorite moment from today was running into Mia out in the wild. Also reading a chapter at a restaurant bar. I couldn’t cop a cafe, but I could a Bijan burger. It wasn’t the best burger but it was good with the goat cheese. For the record, the fries were thin and shriveled, dry and slightly hollow on the inside (reminded me of In N Out). 3/10, would not recommend. Sometimes you go to something, because someone invites you and you think it’s the right thing to do. It’s hit or miss, likely there’s a miracle to be had. At one point, I looked down at my wrist. My whale charm had come undone from my pink and green friendship bracelet. Only an avocado remained, and Mia texted me shortly thereafter.\n“Bro it was terrible…so loud and crowded…came and left.”\nLove,\nElizabeth Kolling"

    "text": "Dear —,\nAt the liqour store on Nostrand Ave, an old woman sits, asleep, in a beach chair, behind the bullet-proof glass. The store is mostly an open floor for customers, and it’s a narrow aisle bordered by shelves that are chock-full of bottles for the owner to reach for. I walk up to her, towards the end of the long runway. There’s a sign that warns about being 21. I’m 25, under-accomplished, and my excuse me rustles her awake. I say, “How much for the Josh?”\n“18.”\nShe sees it on my face, the sure reluctance of a working woman spending what could be savings.\n“15 for this one,” she insists, holding up one of the Projects.\n“And the Bacchus?”\n“13.”\nI ask for both, and carry the paper bags a block and a bit.\nTwo and a half hours later, it’s 10:24 pm. There’s an A train in 8 minutes from the Nostrand Ave station, and I just left my first writer’s group. I said the experience of reading the young woman’s writing was like standing in front of the stovetop, searing something in a cast iron pan. The steam, rising. I stand on the platform, in front of the Fire Department Standpipe Outlet as the rat’s tail threads the third rail.\nToday an acquaintance asked me if I had a black eye. No, I said. It was just my face, the blood in my veins, blue beneath the surface. A thin man is bent over, reaching into a backpack. He’s wearing purple pants made of a shiny fabric with a matching jacket and has a bottle of vodka. Either that, or water.\nThe young woman asked if anyone had ever seen La Ciénaga. I couldn’t remember the name of the fillmmaker, but I remember thinking she was like Alfonso Cuaron, except a woman, without the commercial viability. I mean, success. I Googled her later. Apparently the ex-CEO of Google just purchased a 24 million dollar home in San Francisco, and her name is Lucrecia Martel. Sometimes we consume what we don’t crave. I’ve been staring at the screen for at least eleven hours today.\nLove,\nElizabeth Kolling"

    "text": "Dear —,\nIt’s 7:44 pm on Friday, May 30, 2025, which means I just missed my train, and the next F to Downtown & Brooklyn is in 13 minutes. Is it possible just to be, the luckiest unlucky person, or not to be? Now I see a perfectly clean seat to sit on, and have the opportunity to write whilst I wait. It’s my first time sitting on a subway platform bench, in all the (seven) years I’ve lived in this inspiring, (only slightly) dirty city, and the F train is rocking into the 57th Street station as I think of all the years we’ve called each other friends. Part of me wonders how in the world thirteen minutes have passed, and I’ve only managed to pen this much on the back of a postcard. I feel like the woman in the painting, who reminded me of you, deep in thought, with books on the table in front of her, I’m sure, a writing utensil in her right hand, and an infinite number of ideas in her head. She’s very fashionably dressed. Her green scarf reminds me of the denim skirt you wore, and polka-dotted long-sleeve henley, when we met up at the MET earlier this spring. This book I hope will offer you something along your creative path. I look forward to reading what you write, and one day seeing your name on a book cover, in the store of some independent bookseller on the lower east side of Manhattan, like Sweet Pickle Books, or McNally Jackson on Fulton. Rooting for you, and in your corner—always. Happy birthday, and summer solstice.\nLove,\nElizabeth Rose Aurora Bee Rain Kolling"

As he threads the furthest edge of the sidewalk, no one notices his suspicious pace or held-back tears or bloodied lip.\nThe people hold tight to their garbage bags along Pearl Street, awaiting the small but potent storeowner’s green light. He’s a short, frail main, with stage four, standing at the same doorstep as his father. He puts the neon BIC in his shirt pocket and starts smoking the cigarette. The people breathe in each exhale as he looks out. It’s a mass but not a sea, and it won’t be a record day.\nWith a sigh, he flicks the butt to the ground and lets the ember glow. Reaching for the broom, he catches a glimpse of his son and daughter who are inside sorting Saturday’s stock. He smiles weakly and then turns away.

Like when they’d whip out their scrolls and hold it up to the sea?”\n“Definitely. I guess back in the day, when mapmaking was an actual profession, cartographers would insert fake places or streets or green spaces on their maps so that no one would try to copy them.”\n“So no one would copy them?”\n“It was like a trap. So, if one cartographer did all this great work and another cartographer wanted to use it to cash in themselves…basically, if the second cartographer stole the other guy’s map, the court would be able to tell because the second guy’s map would have the fake towns of the first guy’s so it’d be obvious that they stole their design or map or whatever.”\n“So it was like a legal claim over their work?”\n“Yeah, it was for copyright basically.”\n“That’s what I tell Mrs. S every time I turn in an essay and she comes back with corrections.”\n“You tell her—”\n“I tell her this misspelling or this floating comma was all to ensure my claim.”\n“You’re so full of shit.”\n“It worked the first time.”\n“No way, dude.”\n“Yeah, you’re right.”\n“So that’s basically what I thought of with the mention that ‘true places never are,’ on maps.

Let me see.”\n“Oh, here, wait they’re not street people,” said Levi. “It’s the Mediterranean mariners who are jostling ’the affrighted ladies.”\n“So women are only characters when they’re frightened and nervous.”\n“Wait, women are in the chapel too right?”\n“Oh, yeah, maybe.”\n“Yeah, here, in The Sermon, with reference to the ’shuffling of women’s shoes.”\n“Right.”\n“Back to Queequeg and whether he’s really a woman,” said Levi. “It’s kind of a heterocentric lens to look through.”\n“Maybe, but it’s probably more likely, right?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“As far as statistics go?”\n“Respectfully, what are you talking about?”\n“There are more straight people than there are gay, right?”\n“I don’t know about that, according to who?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“I think there are confounding variables also affecting your statistic there.”\n“Maybe.”\n“It’s a spectrum right?”\n“I guess.”\n“But also, like, it’s a hypermasculine lens as well, right?”\n“I mean—”\n“Look at us,” said Levi. “We’re bed-mates but we don’t want to have sex with each other.”\n“Yeah, true.”\n“Some guys are so insecure and feel like they have to be a certain way.”\n“Talk a certain way.”\n“Walk a certain way.”\n“Cole walks on his tip-toes, and he has a girlfriend.”\n“He hasn’t come into himself yet.”\n“I kind of want Ishmael to be gay.”\n“You do?”\n“Hell yeah,” said Ethan. “That would make Moby-Dick like so subversive for its time.”\n“Yeah.”\n“It’d be a cool legacy.”\n“Speaking of, are you going to apply to Stanford?”\n“Why?”\n“Just wondering.”\n“Because I have legacy?”\n“I mean yeah.”\n“Obviosuly.”\n“Sweet.”\n“Stanford’s like hard for legacies.”\n“I had my meeting with Cheryl the other day.”\n“Yeah? How’d it go?”\n“Yeah, and she was so fake, speaking of fake places, any way, she said ‘our school has a successful track record of Stanford acceptances.’”\n“You’re gonna apply?”\n“I might, haven’t decided, I mean, we’re only sophomores,” said Levi. “Or about to be, any way, what she failed to also say is all of these accepted students had at least one parent with Stanford as an alma mater.”"

    "text": "“I hit the jackpot,” said Levi.\nHe said this to Ethan who was keen on visiting Samantha at the ice cream shop every Saturday evening. After book club, Levi would walk the bike path too and then peel off to catch the book store before closing. He was looking for the Cherry Orchard, but they weren’t there yet. Levi was taking his merry time, stopping at particularly juicy sections of the bramble.\n“Come on,” Ethan said. “It closes in 14 minutes.”\n“One sec, I’ve hit a gold mine.”\nEthan wasn’t the most adventurous fifteen year-old, and he hated being late to his own plans. He watched as Levi reached some more.\n“Sam says the new flavor this week is killer.”\n“Okay, okay,” Levi said as he reversed himself from the little daggers and came over with a big purple mess of a smile. One of his hands was covering the other, which was cupped, as a safeguard. “Check these out.”\n“Woah, what are those?”\n“Loganberries.”\n“Loganberries? They’re, like, long.”\n“They’re sweeter, less of a tang.”\n“Levi, I think you just don’t know how to pick ’em. All the blackberries I’ve ever had have been big and sweet and delicious. Zero tang, until you started picking them. The ones you’re handing me are small and sour.”\n“Hey, I’m working with what I have. It’s not like these are the same berries. These aren’t the same berries as even a few years ago.”\n“What do you mean, the bush is not pushing the same berries as before?”\n“Yeah, for a bunch of reasons.”\n“Okay, enlighten me.”\n“For one, we’re in a drought. There’s not enough water to juice them up. You know how the ones in the grocery store are so huge all the time? It’s ’cause they’re irrigated.”\n“They just pump water into them?”\n“Yeah. And now there’s all this eucalyptus here blocking the sun.”\n“The trees grew fast.”\n“Yeah, cause they’re invasive. And they’re not even originally from here.”\n“Okay, xenophobe.”\n“You know what I mean,” said Levi. “They’re not native.”\n“Neither are blackberries.”\n“Not the Himalayan, but there is a coast berry that grows up the coast.”\n“Naturally.”\n“You wouldn’t like them.”\n“They’re small.”\n“Hey, size doesn’t matter.”\n“Just try these loganberries already.”\n[Ethan takes a berry from Levi’s hand and tries it]\n“Mmm, I like that.”\n“Right?”\n“Mmm, get me more of those.”\n[Ethan grabs for a few more. Levi lets him have them.]\n“There’s only one bush, and I pretty much cleaned it.”\n“Alright, we’ll come back in a few weeks.”\n“Oh, that reminds me,” said Levi. “When do you want to go?”\n“Where?”\n“To the sagebrush?”\n“Don’t we have enough bushes around us already?”\n“Come on, it’ll be fun (It’ll be an adventure).”\n“Fine, okay.”\n“You’re no fun.”\n“Yeah I am.”\n“Then act like it.”\n“Okay, some time next week?”\n“I mean, yeah, but, like, when?”\n“Uh, well, I have this summer info session thing I have to go to on—”\n“What day?”\n“Uh, Tuesday or Wednesday,” said Ethan. “Tuesday, I think.”\n“Okay, so then let’s leave early Thursday morning. I’m thinking 5 am.”\n“Hold, on, Levi, I mean, are these bushes even growing right now.”\n“It’s August.”\n“So?”\n“So, yeah, it’s like peak season. They bloom in late summer.”"

    "text": "“Let’s talk about Chapter 3,” said Ethan.\n“The rooming house.”\n“The house of little to no rooms.”\n“Ah, yes.”\n“I thought it was interesting that it started out basically with a description of a painting.”\n“Right,”\n“Like, he’s so eager and overrun, running himself ragged, trying to find a place to sleep.”\n“Right.”\n“He finally enters, and instead of going right into it, up to the front desk to question the landlord about an available room, it’s all about addressing the painting.”\n“There’s this non-urgency.”\n“It arrests him, and he forgets about the bare minimum—”\n“Bare necessities.”\n“Not even they compare to a painting, maybe is the message.”\n“Right, so is that the point Melville’s trying to make? That people will give up basic needs when faced with ideas, their ideas, their art.”\n“The starving artist.”\n“Right, maybe he’s trying to say that there’s little that matters more than what’s warranted.”\n“Sorry, you lost me.”\n“He uses the word unwarranted to describe the ambition of a young artist driven by the need to ‘delineate.’”\n“‘Chaos bewitched,’” said Ethan. “To capture it, preserve it, no matter how unattainable may be the ‘wild’ thing, near impossible, borderline crazy.”\n“Yeah, any way, it seemed like a whole lot of beating around the bush to get to what’s at the center.”\n“The whale.”\n“Right,” said Levi. “I don’t really know if the painting’s so important. But, maybe it is. We won’t know until we know. My inkling is it’s supposed to represent this book, some stuff at the fringes, but the scene of the whale at the center, so basically, foreshadowing.”\n“I feel like there are a few impaled whales in our future as readers.”\n“Right, well at least one.”\n“What I did find interesting was,” said Ethan. “The line about time, the ‘breaking up of the ice-bound stream of Time’.”\n“Mmm.”\n“Yeah, the idea that time, which I equate with imagination and memory, is fractured, fragmented. I feel like I relate to that,” said Ethan. “I don’t think of things linearly, even things that have yet to come to pass. There are like these glimmers, almost like the sun refracting through water. It’s like time itself or maybe just my attention span bends to this or that, and the littlest thing is cause for the cut to. It’s like a cut to shot in a movie or something whose scenes are totally out of order.”\n“Do you think it just has to do with association?”\n“Huh, yeah, associative memory.”\n“I don’t know how it all works up there, but everything is connected and subconscious until it isn’t.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Any way…”\n“What I also thought was interesting was the description of the whale in the painting.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Yeah,” he describes the whale as purposefully springing upon the harpoon.\n“Where?” Levi said, as Ethan guided him to the bottom of paragraph three.\n“It says, the ‘exasperated whale, purposing to spring…is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.’ I read that, and I was wondering if this whale was suicidal.”\n“Hmm, I think ‘spring clean over the craft’ is the important part of the sentence. The whale has this ultimate aim to clear the ship, but he can’t do it. Instead, he impales himself. I believe it’s inadvertent.”\n“Why do I always read it wrong.”\n“Come on, you don’t always do anything.”\n“I definitely miss the details that make a big difference.”\n“You’re just a fast reader.”\n“It’s like I’m a skimmer, I skim.”\n“Speaking of birds,” said Levi. “Do you want to go check up on the baby owl?”\n“I would,” said Ethan. “But I have to go meet Samantha.”\n“Alright.”"

She was a try-hard with soft edges, and nothing ever did come naturally. How was love any different?\n“Why do you have to assign a double meaning to everything?”\n“I don’t—”\n“Just take things as they are,” Ethan had said to her. “The world isn’t out to get you, it’s not full of ulterior motives, and there is such a thing as nice people.”\nHe was split between those who were they themselves divided, his grandpa and mother, for instance, places as well, and she could never get enough of him that lasted to Sunday. She couldn’t place him. He was here, there, half way around the world for the summer (service trip to Ghana), and she had no more lines to memorize.\nShe decided not to do the summer production. Her single father who raised her and her little brother couldn’t afford it, so she got a job at the ice cream shop (at town center). Plus, she hadn’t gotten the internship."

The oven had been set to 400, which she thought was fifty degrees Fahrenheit too harsh, he was 51 years old, and he’d never read Ray Bradbury. It was all coming back to her, like a motion picture.\n“I can’t believe it,” she had said to him. “It’s an absolute classic.”\n“I’m just as shocked as you are.”\n“Why didn’t you read it like the rest of us?”\n“I went to a private school,” he said. “Nothing about our curriculum was status quo, which is something I’d say I regret, but I’ve never been inspired to revisit it or make up for, I don’t know, lost literature.”\n“We better do something about it.”\n“Oh, yeah?”\n“Yes, I’m going to bring you my copy,” she said, hoping to be the inspiration he’d need to read it finally. “I definitely still have mine, it is packed away somewhere, but it’s somewhere. Maybe Ethan knows. He’s always fishing around in the garage for things.”\n“That’s nice of you, Laura, but really—”\n“Just please, whatever you do, don’t judge my annotations,” she said. “It’s more underlining than anything.”\n“Ah, the great underline.”\n“Yes, it’s an act of pride, really.”\n“Mmm,” said Don, after swallowing some chamomile.\n“I mean, what is it?” She said. “This overwhelming need to underline?”\n“I think we underline the lines that make us feel seen or a little less strange, and maybe we can’t put that into words so readily.”"

    "text": "Ari was affluent, a sixth generation New Yorker and one thirty-second (1/32) Florentine living on West End Avenue, but no stranger turned acquaintance turned close friend, say, would know it unless he said something. It came somewhat as a surprise to Max, but he wasn’t affected either way. He didn’t really care about what a person’s deceased ancestors had done. He was more concerned with what Ari was doing with his life, whether he was squandering the head start or not.\nHis great-great-great-great grandfather (he thinks) was born in 1801 and immigrated to the United States in 1818, before it was very in vogue back then. This meant that Ari could, all these years later, escape any sense of discomfort (the humid months) with the slightest will. Sometime, he’d lean into it and maybe defer to some Hamptons seaside, but more often than not he’d spend summers in Fiesole, Italy, where the family villa still was standing. The weather was better. It’d get hot but not too hot during the day, and then cool off at night, and the sun parlor was unequivocally his favorite room (if he had to choose) to watch the sunset. The summer before freshman year of college, Ari invited Max to see it (and The Birth of Venus) for himself. It faced south, towards Firenze, but Max was more interested in seeing Primavera.\nIl conservatorio, as his Italian tutor, Cate (Caterina) reminded him. The sun parlor looked out at the garden. There were echinacea and chrysanthemum and lilies of the valley, for flowers, and there were tall, tear-shaped cypresses along with fruit trees—pear, mandarin, tangerine, clementine, cara cara, kumquat, loquat, (mostly citrus, and not the season). Also, bushes; yellow raspberries, and blackberries that had to be religiously cut back to avoid overgrowth."

    "text": "June was half done, and the baby was about to leave the nest.\n“I can’t,” Don had said to her before she too leaned in for a kiss, after their game of Twister back in May (that following Saturday). They were beside the hearth (no fire), bent over backwards in his living room, shoes off, one manicured hand on yellow. Another, on green. Laura had her socks on blue, and was flexing her high arch against the mat as Don spun the arrow. He was all on red, still somewhat guarded (same as her), and the tip landed on green.\n“Ah!” Laura said excitedly as he lifted his left leg up and over her lower back and reached for the far circle. It was too far, and he lost his balance. On the come-down, Don wrapped his arms around Laura and rolled onto his side to protect her from all the weight. He was 6’2 and 180 pounds. She was 5’5 and 125, perfectly fine, and crying happy tears.\n“I like your laugh,” he said to her as she rubbed her eyes red.\nDon was on his left side, facing her, and she was on her back, staring up at the ceiling.\n“It’s kind of awful,” she said. “Where hyena meets Santa Claus.”\nHe smiled and let out a small, sweet ahah, still looking at her.\n“Why do you do that?”\n“Do what?”\nHe followed her eyes as she turned over on her right side to look at his sky blue.\n“Put yourself down like that.”\n“Compliments make me uncomfortable.”\n“You’re not comfortable?”\n“No,” she said. “I am.”\nThere was a beat of silence, and then Laura sat up. Don felt the moment fall away from him, and he pressed his palms against the rug (Persian, floral) to sit up too.\n“Is everything okay?”\n“Yeah,” she said. “It’s just…”\n“What?”\n“I should go.”\nIt was still early in the night, not even after eight, and they hadn’t even gotten to the part where they took a walk around the neighborhood.\n“Are you sure?”\n“I’ve got an early morning tomorrow.”\n“Right,” Don said. “Vinyasa with…?”\n“Kundalini,” she said. “With Stan.”\n“I still can’t believe Stan is your yoga teacher.”\n“What do you have against Stan?”\n“No, nothing.”\n“Okay.”\n“He’s the one with the coy fish on his arm, right?”\n“What?”\n“The one with the tattoos?”\n“Yes, he has tattoos, and?”\n“Nothing, just checking.”\n“You’re being weird,” she said.\nDon brushed it off and took one corner of the Twister mat as Laura took another at the other end. They folded it once, so that green met red, and met in the middle. They stood there, facing each other, holding up the mat, knuckles touching knuckles. Only the thin plastic mat separated them, and the game was over. Don leaned in and kissed her. She kissed him back. Then, he pulled away.\n“I can’t….” he said. “We shouldn’t.”\nLaura didn’t say anything at first.\n“I’m so…stupid,” she said.\n“No, you’re not—my mistake.”\n“I should—go.”\n“You don’t have to,” he said.\n“I think I do…have to.”\nLaura plucked her empty wine glass (his tea mug) from the coffee table and walked straight past him to the kitchen sink, where she filled the lipstick-stained glass with tap water and tilted her brain back, twice. She reached for the soap and sponge and started at the rim as Don stood still in the living room, thoughtless, pretty paralyzed. He had felt something, which scared him.\nBy the time Don returned to himself, Laura’s sandals were no longer next to his boots in the breezeway. Halfway home, she had walked the dead end back to Main Street and jaywalked across two lanes of traffic going in opposite directions. She reached the bike trail, alive with feeling, hurt but happy it happened. Bay laurel beckoned, and eucalyptus spread its seed, but the mother owl was long gone as the newborn (Great Horned) nested, abandoned. The weeds were everywhere. The soil on either side of the new pavement was piecemeal picked apart. The blackberries weren’t yet ready, but the bird-box library was aplenty, whispering sweet nothings.\nTake one, leave one, it said to her (and every passerby). Live, and let be."

There was a building named after her, and the drama teacher thought she may have a second chance at hitting the big screen if she did something for them. She even told her she was talented, which was overkill (not a requirement) where they came from. She (and Ethan and Levi and all) walked past the plaque on their way to Western Philosophy and couldn’t help but feel everything about the world was rigged, out of reach, like looking up in the Sistine chapel. She was the pointer finger, strong, proffering with purpose and good intention, and her dreams were a collapsed wrist, indifferent, or like someone who didn’t know what to do with another’s want of connection, Platonic, creating distance.\nThey had been assigned Symposium as summer reading, due on the first day of class.

I’d think a drug addict would prefer to be on land, and in the streets.”\n“I guess,” Levi said, pausing to think for a second. “But I mean, read this section.”\nHe opened the book to the first page of the first chapter, and started reading aloud the first paragraph.\n“Uh-huh,” Ethan said.\n“If Ishmael were depressed, wouldn’t it take a strong moral principle to leave his shitty apartment and step outside, into the street? Here, it’d be saying that when he’s depressed he can’t help himself from getting up and going out, which is hard for me to believe. I feel like if you’re depressed, you just want to sit inside and waste the day away, without motivation or a mission. Now, if you’re a drug addict whose hypos or addiction is getting the better of you, then it takes a strong moral principle to not defer to the street, where your supplier and next high are, or help yourself from knocking people’s hats off. I think the hats part is not to be taken literally. It’s a literary flare, which may be taken to mean getting in a fight, but it could also refer to someone who is just flailing their arms about, swinging aimlessly because they’re in some sort of drug-induced psychosis. I’ve seen that in San Francisco before, especially where the open-air drug markets are, in the Tenderloin, near Turk Street and Hyde. Any way, what else? Oh, yeah! Melville also uses the word high, ‘high time’ he says, which to me connotes drugs and drug use. I don’t know. The need to get to the sea, is maybe the need to save himself, to cut himself off from his assured supply, you know, ashore.”\n“Well, what about the line about pistol and ball?” Ethan said. “Doesn’t that suggest suicide stemming from depression.”\n“You could read it like that, but I also think it applies to the lens of addiction.”\n“I’m listening.”\n“Pistol and ball is basically suicide, and drug use is kind of this implicit suicide, because you’re risking killing yourself. So, taking to the sea could be Ishmael’s substitute for pistol and ball, i.e. doing drugs, i.e. overdosing, i.e. killing himself.”\n“Okay, then what about Cato?”\n“Cato?”\n“Yeah, in the line that follows. Cato died by suicide.”\n“He stabbed himself with a sword, and maybe Ishmael stabbed himself with a needle.”"

    "text": "“I don’t even know what chapter we’re on, but I’m just going to dive right in. My first thought was why did Queequeg leave the chapel before the Benediction.”\n“I also found that odd or at least interesting,” said Ethan. “Also, oof, what’s a Benediction?”\n“It’s basically the point in the service when the people sitting in their seats are blessed.”\n“By the priest?”\n“Or the pastor, or the minister.”\n“I fear I don’t know what is different about these other than the titles.”\n“Have no fear, but we can come back to that.”\n“Sorry, I know I always put you off your course. So, what were you saying about missing the Benediction?”\n“Yeah, I mean, Queequeg leaving the chapel early, before the Benediction, it almost says something about his character. He isn’t attending the service in his own self-interest. He doesn’t feel the need to be blessed, which I think is why a lot of people attend church or chapels or whatever. They want something, they want to be blessed or at least feel blessed, like everything is going to be okay for them.”\n“And Queequeg you’re saying already feels blessed?”\n“Yeah, or at least he doesn’t take what’s free before him. He doesn’t need to take the blessing potentially given to him. While others really rely on this blessing to be okay, maybe he wants to take the harder route to blessedness. Really work for it, you know.”\n“Maybe his spirit is already blessed, I mean he’s carrying around a little idol that I’m sure is blessing him. Here, it says he’s ‘peering hard into its face,’ so maybe it’s a work in progress.”\n“He wants answers.”\n“And he’s not afraid to change his idols.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“He’s with his ’jack-knife…whittling away at its nose.”\n“Gently, so he cares.”\n“Oh, did you hear Mabel got a nose job?”\n“I didn’t hear that.”\n“Yeah, apparently she did in the summer so she can recover before the school year.”\n“Oh.”\n“Yeah apparently it fucks up your whole face, like you get all puffed up with huge black and blue bruises under your eyes and you look like the kiss of death or like you’ve just been in a car accident.”\n“That sounds painful.”\n“Yeah, you’ve got to be a little mentally ill, right? It gives me the shivers just thinking about it.”\n“Yeah, I can’t imagine.”\n“I would never date a girl who got a nose job.”\n“Really, why?”\n“It’s just so unattractive.”\n“Isn’t the purpose to make a person more attractive?”\n“Yeah, but like feeling the need to change your face and carving into it like that.”\n“Hmm.”\n“I mean, if you’re someone who wants to get work done, it sounds like you have a lot of work to do.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Like you’ve got a lot of inner work and healing to do to get to a place where that’s not an option. I don’t know, you gotta get right from the inside out, in my opinion.”\n“I think everyone should feel good, so whatever that means for them.”\n“I bet Mabel is still obsessed with her nose, even after the new one.”\n“Maybe,” said Levi. “Would you break up with Samantha if she got her nose done.”\n“Hah,” Ethan said. “You’re good.”\n“You don’t have to answer.”\n“No, it’s a good question. Yeah, I probably would.”\n“Damn.”\n“I mean the nose is very important. A new nose can change your whole appearance.”\n“Do you think—”\n“But Samantha would never. She likes the way she looks.”\n“Yeah, do you think Mabel is unrecognizable?”\n“We’ll just have to wait and see.”\n“I’ll bet you like 20 bucks.”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Fine, let’s say ten.”\n“Betting money on that feels bad.”\n“Fine, how ’bout I bet you a blunt.”\n“Wait, that just reminded me—”\n“Yeah?”\n“I liked the part where Ishmael claims he is a good, a good Christian.”\n“Oh, yeah.”\n“It felt like a tone shift.”\n“What does it mean to be a good Christian?”\n“Uh—”\n“Maybe loving the body God gave you, to start.”\n“Right,” said Levi, turning to the page. He was trying to decipher his own annotations in the margins and in-line (above and below the black print) with the text.\n“Okay, I’ll be serious.”\n“Here, he effectively defines what it means to be good.”\n“Where?”\n“Here, he says, ’…the will of God?—to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—that is the will of God.”\n“Interesting.”\n“So, he’s equating goodness with the will of God as well.”\n“And the will of God is worship?”\n“I guess so.”\n“I like how he expresses the importance of respecting other forms of religion.”\n“Mmm, yeah!”\n“He basically confronts God.”\n“Mmm.”\n“Here, he denies that God is a jealous person—God, I mean. He says, ‘Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth…can possibly be jealous…’”\n“I think the ending of that sentence is also important to consider. He goes on referring to Queequeg’s beloved idol as an ‘insignificant bit of black wood.’ Frankly, he’s insulting other belief systems. Or saying, yeah, I’ll respect your religion or its existence, as long as mine is the superior.”\n“So, he’s still establishing a hierarchy.”\n“I think so. Also, separately, framing this as a question addressed to Ishmael is kind of inception-like. It’s like, okay, is this God speaking to Ishmael through Ishmael, or is Ishmael’s interior just fully out there. The difference between first and second person, I guess, is my point. And Melville chose to invoke second person here.”\n“Back to the hierarchy,” said Ethan who hadn’t really been listening to what Levi just said (thoughts had a way of slipping through the ___ and he wanted to remember what he had thought of to say). “He does though recognize the need for mutual respect.”\n“Mutuality, definitely, right, the idea that belief systems are not mutually exclusive, here he says that unity is achieved by participating in each respective form of worship is what it means to doing the same unto others.”\n“I low-key read it as conversion, but mutual conversion, so like is anyone just one thing—Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Daoist, Jainist, Jewish, Hindu, or are we all of them, together One. Not to be cheesy.”\n“In a world that is overwhelmingly lactose intolerant.”\n“Lol,” Ethan said (actually said it aloud).\n“Also, Ishmael is pretty subversive, and he’s evolving as a character.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“He walked the talked and followed through,” said Ethan. “He did the worship ritual with him.”\n“Now, for the knocking of hats off.”\n“What do you worship?”\n“My nose. Oh, and my calf muscles,” Ethan said as he lifted his leg and flexed. “See?”\n“Oh, I see.”\n“What about you?”\n“I’ve never thought about it.”\n“Come on.”\n“I guess whatever book I’m reading currently.”\n“Hell yeah.”\n“Melville’s resting happy.”\n“When did he die, by the way?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Let’s look it up.”\n“Got it,” said Levi. “1891?”\n“Okay, so 1819…he was what, seventy—”\n“One, 72.”\n“What about you?”\n“What about me what?”\n“I’m just thinking about what we were talking about,” said Ethan. “Would you date a girl who had a nose job or wanted to get one?”\n“I would.”\n“You would?”\n“Yeah, I mean, it’s her body, her choice,” said Levi. “Either way, it’s about the soul, as Melville says.”\n“Where does he say that?”\n“Well, he brings up the soul.”\n“When, where?”\n“Uh, third paragraph. Here, ‘you cannot hide the soul.’”\n“Some souls I prefer to others.”\n“What if it’s all one soul,” said Levi. “One body, one soul.”\n“Do you believe in soul mates?”\n“I think I do.”\n“I don’t,” said Ethan. “Would you ever date someone with tattoos?”\n“I think I would.”\n“What if they were unearthly?”\n“What does that mean?”\n“Samantha wants to get one on her back.”\n“Of what?”\n“She wants an avocado with the pit still in it.”\n“Okay.”\n“It’s a nightmare. I’m trying to convince her.”\n“Why on her back?”\n“I don’t know,” said Ethan. “Maybe so she doesn’t have to see it.”\n“That’s harsh.”\n“Well, I’ll be the one who has to look at it.”\n“I don’t know dude,” said Levi. “You should support her.”\n“When are you gonna get a girlfriend or at least a bosom friend?”\n“Patience, my soon-to-be bedmate.”\n“I’m so psyched for camping.”\n“What time are we leaving tomorrow?”\n“I’ll ask the madre.”\n“Sweet.”\n“Wait, why isn’t your dad coming?”\nLevi didn’t want to tell him, because he didn’t know if Ethan could handle it. So Levi lied a little but not very well. He said,\n“I don’t know.”"

From the Quakers? Seriously, so what’s up with all this Shakespearean language?”\n“I’ve to say they dost defy every preconceived notion I once had of what it means to be a seaman.”\n“They’re sophisticated seamen. Talk so proper.”\n“It’s like these co-captains are co-conspirators.”\n“Yeah, I don’t trust them.”\n“That’s what an education will do to you.”\n“What?”\n“Cultivate a distrust, or it’ll bring out the “stately dramatic” in thee and make thou entirely unintelligible.”\n“Huh? Don’t you mean intelligible?”\n“No, I mean what I said.”\n“But that’s the opposite of what you were saying, right. These co-captains are educated and therefore highly intelligible.”\n“I mean unintelligible in the philosophical sense, intelligible only to those who are also educated. They’re unable to speak frankly. It’s just flowers.”\n“I’m confused. What do you have against Shakespeare?”\n“What? Nothing. I think we’ve gone off track.”\n“No, I mean, it’s fine, just what’s the philosophical definition of unintelligible again?”\n“I don’t know if it’s an official term, but I’m thinking about it as the opposite of intelligible,” said Levi. “So, being able to be understood by the senses instead of the intellect.”\n“So this implies that the person with the understanding has a good sense rather than intellect?”\n“I guess.”\n“So, is Ishmael not educated?”\n“No, I mean I think he is.”\n“He seems like he’s able to understand them. He seems like he has a good sense of the people he meets.”\n“He understands that they are phonies, or at least hypocrites.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well, there’s this contradiction, where is it, doesn’t he talk about how they are civility sponges (soaking up Scripture) while meanwhile some of the most violent whalers out there, let’s see, here, he says, “there are…men, who, named with Scripture names…and…naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou…still…strangely blend with these outgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.”\n“Okay,” said Ethan. “So what’s he saying?”\n“I think he’s saying that every religiously educated man has the capacity or even the inclination to do violence. They can be simultaneously elegant speakers and vengeful fighters with blood on their hands.”\n“Where does their anger come from?”\n“Inheritance. The Viking Age, I guess.”\n“And the Romans.”\n“The Greeks were all peace compared to them.”"

    "text": "Sara’s parents and Sara’s parents’ parents and Sara’s parents’ parents’ parents on both sides were patrons of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, old money, which meant her mother didn’t work for a living and spent an hour, maybe two, on the weekends volunteering.\n“Volunteering is the greatest feeling,” she had said to her daughter. “It’s also a form of service, and it’s important what we’re doing, making a difference,” but Sara saw her mother’s motivation as more of a status symbol and something to brag about at dinner parties or a way to stave off her loss. In fact, Sara had tilted her head and furrowed her brow (incomplete agreement) before realizing it.\n“Don’t squint, honey, you’ll get wrinkles.”\nHer mother had not even one, thank God and thanks to no injector in high demand on the Upper East Side. The injector’s wife was her surgeon (generally she was against invasive procedures or changing her appearance and she had only ever had her nose done), and they owned a practice together, which she thought was sweet. She liked supporting small, family-owned businesses even though she wanted tighter borders and lower taxes. She didn’t believe in government but she’d give a twenty dollar bill to every homeless woman on the sidewalk or migrant mother trying to sell fresh fruit in Central Park. She’d seen more than one getting arrested by the NYPD.\n“It’s just heartbreaking,” she’d said in her silk gown to the middle-aged financier fingering a cigar in front of her.\nShe, who was known to kiss her husband even though his lips tasted of tobacco, had the view that women weren’t the ones doing drugs.\n“I just can’t picture it.”\nShe always carried a banana and a bag of almonds in her purse in case she passed one in NoHo, off the Broadway Lafayette subway stop (which she’d only ever walked past on her way to SoHo). For one, she thought it was important not to spike the blood sugar. Doing so could make a person age five years, according to science or her own fiction, and nuts were good to pair for this purpose (not too many at once, because they contained cyanide and could make you sick).\nEssentially, she gave the men in the streets food instead, she told him, because she didn’t trust them (she didn’t know what use the men would make of the money).\n“I mean, I can’t speak for them,” he had said with a puff and a croak.\n“Won’t you quit?”\n“Okay, I’ll quit for you.”\nThe middle-aged financier fingering a cigar in front of her had wanted to study at Juilliard, and he’d gotten in on his own merit, having filled out the application under a pseudonym, but his ill father’s deathbed wish was for his son to take over the boutique firm. He went to Princeton and hadn’t played seriously since the audition. Any way, Sara’s mother could talk for hours. She could listen too as long as her audience was handsome enough, and her husband was handsome.\n“Do you regret it?”\n“What?”\n“Going to Princeton?”\n“Not an ounce of it.”\n“Regret, you mean?” She said. “Do you regret meeting me?”\n“Now, you’re the reason I don’t regret anything.”\n“You mean it?”\n“If I hadn’t gone to Princeton, I would’ve never seen you from across the room.”\n“I thought we met in the library.”\n“No it was a party.”\n“Maybe it was both.”\n“So, you’ll quit?”\n“I guess.”\n“You guess, my love?”\n“I will.”\n“I just don’t want you to resent me.”\n“How could I resent you?” He said, turning to face Sara. “Look what you’ve given me.”\nSara thought she was in trouble or something but was then relieved when her mother and father turned away to face each other again, only to throw up a little in her mouth at the sight of them flirting with each other in public at a private event. They really loved each other, Catherine and James Ascher, college sweethearts, which was totally gross and rare.\n“You could always start up again,” Catherine said.\n“Hmm?”\n“Saxophone.”\nRegardless of standing in opposition to some of the things her mother and father represented, Sara couldn’t help but be cut from that same cloth, and the more she heard her say it (volunteering is…) while slurping a farmed shrimp cocktail on a rooftop overlooking the Reservoir, the more she believed it to be incontrovertibly true. Either way, she effectively grew up a the MET.\nAt the age of eight months, Sara was climbing the grand steps at a crawl (her mother would set her loose), and by age seven she was manning the information desk (which those on the inside called the pit), and by eleven she was upstairs with events and programming, but by the time she reached high school, she had told her mom that she wanted to help with curating. A phone call was all it took, and she found herself in a room with PhDs who didn’t mind that she had no justification for being there other than where she came from. They had come from the same place, of course.\nAny way, this is how Sara started up volunteering and why she and Max found themselves in Gallery 821 on a Friday, staring at Latour’s Roses and Lilies.\nShe had broken the silence by saying the roses looked like cabbages.\n“No they don’t,” said Max.\n“The lilies look like yearning.”\n“I see that.”\nShe had tilted her head towards him to mirror the slant of the white flowers in the vase.\n“You can tell there’s water in it.”\n“Yeah.”\n“I like the tension of the stems’ ends against the glass,” she said. “It’s almost like they’re trying to break through, but they can’t.”\n“And the leader flower, somehow, it doesn’t bend.”\n“Yeah, it looks like it would bend like the ones beneath it.”\n“There’s some bend in the stems to the left.”\n“Yeah.”\n“I can’t quite track the stems to the flowers,” he said. “They all blend.”\n“I think that section, where all the stems converge, is my favorite section of the painting.”\n“Yeah.”\n“I could stare at it for hours,” she said. “Or a few minutes, and it wouldn’t make a difference.”\nIt’d been at least three in front of this one, and more than one stranger had come up to it with their iPhone to take a picture only to immediately move on. The two of them saw people do this, time after time, but they were different. Hers was in her purse. His Android, in his jean pocket."

We’d see each other walking towards each other, and—”\n“And, what? Then what?”\nHerbert went by Herb, and Max had developed the overwhelming feeling that Sara was his soulmate, everywhere he was and nowhere, haunting him.\nIt wasn’t like he could just text her out of the blue.

They talked about the un-touchy things, once or twice a month. His mother cheated with his kindergarten teacher, as he pieced it together, which meant he and his sister had to share a room and he was ever skeptical of the education system. Their apartment was a two-bedroom, one bath, small and naturally dark. He preferred the lights off, because they were otherwise blinding (LEDs). The rent-controlled co-op building was pre-war, on the Upper West Side, and he had to get glasses in the second grade. At least, that’s what he told the kids in school one day after weeks of calling him names.\n“Near the Museum.”\nHe said this to one kid by the cubbies, and then started making his rounds each recess.\nThe natural history buffs would be all buggy-eyed, thinking it was so cool, ’cause the Museum of Natural History was all the rage at that age. He’d be relieved momentarily, knowing deep down he was a phony. They’d invite him to tag along after school for the walks home. He’d peel away from the group walking downtown around 81st and Columbus and walk slowly towards Central Park West until he was sure no one was watching him. Then, he’d walk back up—sixteen or so blocks and two avenues west until he reached Manhattan Valley.\nHe was ashamed of who he was—where he lived, where he came from. He felt the shame of association, which turned into deep dislike and then eventual indifference. He didn’t really like his father or his mother or his sister. His parents weren’t the smartest people, and his sister was a cry baby. He hated how quick she was to play victim and put herself at the center.\nHe hadn’t always felt this way, she’d eventually remind him (when he started acting really sour towards her). There were the first few times after the divorce, where he’d get out of bed to console his sister. He’d tap her shoulder, brush his thumb across her temple towards her part and then tuck her hair behind her ear. He’d shh shh shhhh her until the tears down her cheek were dry, and she’d fall asleep.\nHis friends were his family, and he found any good enough reason to belong elesewhere."

His socks hadn’t been washed for a few games and he was a shorter fellow, second string. Coach had been substituting him in, late in the second halves.\nLevi wouldn’t play much, but he’d put his best foot forward when he was out there, kicking rocks, and he’d have a way of always seeing the silver lining in any sort of messed up situation.\n“Hey,” Ethan said back, as he turned to face him. “Levi, right?”\n“Holden’s kind of a dick.”\n“Really?”\n“Don’t you think?”\n“I don’t know,” he said, still wondering if he’d guessed his name correctly. It’d only been two weeks since the start of the season. “I mean, I think, for me, it’s too early to tell.”\n“Huh, how far are you?”\n“Huh?”\n“In the book,” he said. “What’s happening right now in the book?”\n“Oh, right,” he said. “I’m at the part where he’s in a cab.”\n“Which cab?”\n“There’s more than one?”\n“The first or the second?\nEthan took his thumb out from between the pages and turned the book, now closed cover to cover, so Levi could see where the book mark was. Levi saw the width of the pages towards the back cover, thicker than he had previously thought. He nodded his head in the affirmative and then shook it left to right as he let out a disappointed sigh.\n“There’s not more than ten,” Levi said. “But there is more than one.”\n“I’ve got that to look forward to.”\n“You don’t like it so far?”\n“No, I mean, I like it.”\n“It’s a classic, but I know what you mean.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Well, we should talk about it when you finish.”\n“Yeah,” Ethan said. “Okay.”\n“We could start a book club.”\n“That’d be cool.”\n“For sure,” Ethan said as Levi turned back around and readjusted only to pull his foot to his face. Ethan threw up in his mouth a little bit at the sight of it, but Levi thought the sock smelled all right.\nThe school bus was making its way over rolling hills, back through West Marin, and Ethan was well past the part about Holden debating the pimp, by the time he checked his phone. One missed call, and Samantha had sent him a text.\n“Have a great game my forward,” she said. “Go score some goals, I love you.”\nEven though her less than sign next to the number three formed a heart, he sent a colon with a closing parenthesis and called back.\n“It was good,” he said to her. “I scored two goals!”\n“Congratulations, honey!”\n“Thanks, Mom.”\n“So,” Laura said. “What was the final score?”\n“Two to one, us, them.”"

She rolled over with an expectant smile in her eyes to find James (as usual) not in bed beside her. She thought maybe things would be different this Sunday, but they were the same as she braced the silk sheets with her outstretched palms alone and pushed herself up against the headboard. With a swift adjusting of his or her silk-cased pillows, she settled into the perfect position and was relieved to see the tall glass of iced coffee resting there on the table. There was also a little vase with a singular baby pink rose next to her plugged-in phone, so maybe he did still care.\nMaybe he’d risen earlier with a kiss on her shoulder and mixed in a bit of cream and sugar as usual in the kitchen. Maybe he’d brought the glass to the bedside table, where she’d left her phone inches from the outlet and got it charging for her. Maybe he’d gone on a run around the reservoir, as he’d been wanting to do since before the start of the heat wave. Maybe he hadn’t taken his cigar to the same bench as before, but she didn’t want to think about what maybe was. Maybe he’d gotten dressed in running gear to give the appearance of having gone on a run. She was tired of not knowing, not having answers. La Méridienne was an alternate name of the painting, she knew, a gift from Max, and James had a Sunday and Tuesday and Thursday and Saturday tradition (every other day save weekends).\n“A reinterpretation of Van Gogh’s, which he reinterpretated after Millet’s.”\n“Thank you, Max, it’s very nice. I’ll ask Sara and James where we’d like to put it.”\nJames arose that Sunday as usual. He made his wife coffee the way she liked it (extra sweet, extra ice cold), and then walked a block west to Museum Mile and south past Engineers’ Gate. He picked a bench in front of Guggenheim and sat there a while. He puffed his cigar (essentially), considering the water damage as well as Le Corbusier.\n“It’s tradition,” James would say.\n“It’s not some kind of homemade casserole that’s been passed down, James.”\n“It’s time for me.”\n“It hurts me that you don’t care that you’re killing yourself.”\n“That’s a little dramatic, Catherine.”\n“You said you’d quit.”\n“I say a lot of things.”\n“James, I can’t do this.”\n“I’m just joking around. I will, come fall, but it’s summer.”\nCatherine sat in bed, sipping her iced coffee, scrolling Facebook. She saw that her childhood best friend had gone camping, and Ethan was growing up fast. Laura Chase didn’t take it personally that Catherine hadn’t posted on her timeline for her birthday. She loved to post the highlight reel of her life online, and that was fine, but she knew Catherine only kept her profile out of convention and was rarely on the thing. Besides, Catherine had tried to call and did leave a really sweet voicemail. There was no service then where they were, so she only days later received the wishes."

Ethan’s eyes were already glazed over by the thought of his father.\n“You don’t know what?”\n“I don’t know what he was thinking,” Ethan said, turning to face him. “He could’ve just packed the orange whole.”\n“What?”\n“He cut it up and he put the pieces in a plastic bag.”\n“Huh?”\n“He could’ve thought of the skin.”\n“Ethan.”\n“The skin is what held the pieces together. It was already built in.”\n“I know.”\n“For years. He asked if I wanted orange slices, and he handed me a plastic bag.”\n“Ethan!” Levi said, finally raising his voice. “Why are you saying this?”\n“I’m saying this, because you know what that is?”\n“What is it? Tell me.”\n“Taking an orange and cutting it into pieces and putting each wet piece into a plastic bag to take on a hike when it naturally has a whole protective layer which you can peel, that’s depression.”\n“Are you sure?”\n“We should’ve taken turns peeling, and split it in half and peeled each piece one at a time, together. Instead, we were creating trash. It’s everything he was against. It doesn’t make sense.”\n“I’m sorry,” said Levi.\nEthan looked down at the table and didn’t say anything for a few minutes.\n“Is this mine?”\n“Yeah, it’s yours.”\nHe put the joint between his lips and patted himself down for a lighter. It was already out, beside him on the couch.\n“Hey,” Levi said. “Do you want to go on a walk? Outside? Fresh air? Change of scenery?\nEthan lit the thing and leaned back on the exhale.\n“Change of scenery? Where does that come from?”\n“I don’t know,” he said. “Sometimes, everyone needs a change of scenery…It’s something my mom used to say.”\nEthan looked at him.\n“Okay.”\nIt was 101 degrees that day, the peak of summer. Fourth of July was just around the corner, and Laura was planning to throw a party for after the parade."

    "text": "William was close to Gold, she’d later learn.\n“What isn’t beautiful about her?”\n“Her lips are thin.”\n“Mmm.”\n“Her mouth is small. Her nose is too narrow, and you can tell there’s a curvature to it.”\n“You mean it’s not a flat bridge?”\n“I don’t know much about noses,” Max said. “Is that what it’s called?”\n“My mom had her nose done,” said Sara, still facing the woman in the painting. “She doesn’t know I know.”\n“How do you know?”\n“I just do.”\n“That’s not very convincing.”\n“I have a good sense of plastic surgery.”\n“Why’s that?”\n“I don’t know. It never looks right.”\n“So something’s just off about your mom?”\n“I guess. She’d say the opposite.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“She thinks my dad’s having an affair.”\n“Oh, I’m sorry.”\n“What for?”\n“Your dad having an affair, that’s too bad.”\n“He’s not though.”\n“Oh.”\n“I know he’s not.”\n“So why don’t you tell her?”\n“My mom? She wouldn’t believe me. She’s someone who has to find out for herself. So, it’s just a matter of time that her investigation draws no conclusion.”\n“Sara, that’s kind of wack.”\n“I don’t know. I try to stay out of the drama.”\n“Yeah,” Max said (acutely aware that Sara has been the one to bring just that into his own life as of late).\n“So what else about her?\n“Who?”\n“Her,” Sara said, raising her chin to the woman in the painting. Max wasn’t looking at her. He was looking at Sara, and he didn’t realize it but his toes had even drifted from the painting and towards Sara. He remembered what he’d read about how desire is subconscious expressed through the positioning of our feet. It was a mistake, so Max quickly turned his ankle towards her instead (Madame Frederic Breyer, ca. 1858).\n“The length of her face is too long. She has a short jaw and her forehead is like—”\n“A man’s,” said Sara.\n“She has nice eyes.”\n“Big, round?”\n“Blue,” Max blurted out, but Sara didn’t realize that the color applied to her too, he continued.\n“Her hair is thin. Her hair line is receding.”\n“She has an Adam’s Apple.”\n“Only men have those, right?”\n“Yeah, and there at center, the dip is really severe where her collar bones meet.”\nSara brought her thumb up to her own and pressed down, not sure what hers meant.\n“Is that unattractive?”\n“I think it means she’s unhealthy.”\n“How?”\n“I think it’s called the jugular notch,” Max said.\n“That’s a terrible name.”\n“I think it sticks out, or gets more pronounced when you’re underweight.”\nSara traced his neck down with her big, round eyes and noticed how his was also pretty pronounced.\n“Do you want to get some food after?”\n“Maybe,” Max said, not really interested.\n“There’s always extra left over, and it’s super tasty.”\n“I do want to find this painting.”\n“Right,” Sara said. “Do you want to keep looking?”\n“Yeah,” he said, still looking at the dark canvas. “You can’t see half her face.”\n“She’s a bit mystified.”\n“Maybe that’s her appeal,” Max said. “Maybe that’s why Courbet wanted to paint her.”\n“I think he was paid to paint her, which is why he wanted to paint her, and he painted half of her into a sad, dark obscurity.”\n“See her hands?”\n“You can tell she’s uncomfortable.”\n“She probably doesn’t think she’s a worthy subject.”\n“She’s hiding behind her forefinger but her thumb is the brave one,” Max said.\n“If you couldn’t have one finger, which one would it be?”\n“Pinky,” he said. “You?”\n“I think the one next to that one.”\n“Your ring finger?”\n“Yeah, I guess the left hand would make sense,” she said. “You’re left handed.”\n“How do you know?”\n“I don’t know, it’s just obvious.”\n“Okay, stalker.”\n“That’s not what that means. It just means I’ve noticed.”\n“What it really means is I’m smarter than you.”\n“Oh yeah? I think it means I’m always right.”"

    "text": "Her son had a lot of friends from high school, to start, but he had a way of dwindling the circle down like it was a jolly rancher getting rotated about in the mouth of the girl with the long brown hair from freshman year. He was a nice guy, and the other girls liked him too, but he didn’t much mind them. He only had eyes for the one, and he was more intent on what he was reading. The guys on the soccer team called him grim or the reader or the grim reader, one after the other, on the way to games.\n“How’s it going, Grim?”\n“What’s the reader reading today?”\n“Watch out the grim reader’s right behind you,” Cole would say in the seat behind him on the bus.\nIt was just fun and games, a play on the grim reaper, because he always had this look on his face when he was staring down at a page, like he was depressed or something. It was a cool November in his soul, he’d say to the guys, all serious, just to freak them out, but they always knew he was messing around. The thing he hated about being on the soccer team was that it always took him away from the school day. He’d have to leave Western Philosophy early, and he always felt like he was missing the part where everything made sense. He liked Plato best, because Plato was a bit of a romantic despite what the Stoics said.\nSomething good did come of it, though. The one girl with the long brown hair who always sat in what seemed to be the farthest seat possible from him, turned around one day and volunteered to take notes and send them to him. She had this incredible handwriting, and her notes were extremely meticulous, not sporadic or like Pollock in front of a tawny canvas. They were complete, converging, and read like little short stories. She was definitely smarter than him, which is why he loved her. He’d had this crush on her for at least a month into the note-taking before he mustered the courage to ask her out. He asked her if she wanted to go get ice cream, and that was that. They both liked mint chip, and before his mother knew it: Ethan, which didn’t mean noble or well-born or son of destiny, had a girlfriend in high school.\nLaura hated that they were together. She hated the girlfriend and this was revealed first in small ways but then pretty obviously at a certain point in time, maybe halfway through junior year, so he knew it’d never amount to much. She was pretty and a free spirit, she showed him things, and sometimes didn’t wear shoes when she walked around which upset him and was the only other major tension. It was good for now, not forever, and he was fine either way. Senior year came and graduation day, walking across the stage, and he broke it off with Samantha a few weeks later before she left for college. She was going on a pre-orientation water rafting trip, and he was able to do that sort of thing—be present and apparently sincere, but critical of himself and others on the inside. He had his best kept secrets and he cared a lot about what others thought, especially his mother who had decided early on to hold a grudge, never let it go, and let it fester like her toenail fungus, which she painted with prescription Ciclopirox every morning after yoga.\n“I want you to experience everything in its fullness,” he had said to her. “Not in distance.”\nEven in the bitter end she believed he was sweet, and maybe she looked just too good in flip flops."

    "text": "Everywhere he looks are people suffering, hot, cold shivers, without health care. A man sleeps on a vent (warm in winter, cool in summer) outside the school he goes to on scholarship (not merit-based), and against the facade of a multi-billion dollar high-rise that they named Steinway.\nMax was a serial quitter. He quit piano when he was nine years old. It wasn’t for him. It was his mother who couldn’t afford it anymore, and his dad didn’t find out until years later, when he found himself in a room of people egging his son on, asking the two of them to play Joy to the World together. He was getting skinnier then, though no one seemed to notice all but the leftover peas on his plate. They’d been boiled a few days prior and left for spoil on the stovetop, then saved, and the thought of food made him lose his appetite.\nHe was sitting by the window seat, staring at a raisin roll, which was basically a cinnamon roll without the cream cheese frosting, with cinnamon, layers and all, wondering whether or not he should eat it or save it for later when he really was starved.\n“You know” he said to her. “I’m not hungry.”\n“Oh, really?”\n“I shouldn’t have gotten this,” he said. “I was just going to get coffee, and then I don’t know.”\n“I don’t know how you drink it straight black.”\n“Huh?”\n“The coffee,” she said, with a nod of her head towards the scratched-up white mug.\n“Try it.”\nShe took a sip of it, while maintaining eye contact, swallowed and stuck out her tongue.\n“The coffee’s pretty shit.”\n“Isn’t that why people come here?” He said. “It’s part of the aesthetic.”\n“The aesthetic?”\n“Yes.”\n“And what would you call it?”\n“Dim, intellectual…communal bathroom, soupy, definitely sweaty.”\n“So, aesthetics,” she said, looking through the lens and into his amber eyes. “That’s your final answer?”"

    "text": "He wanted Max to tell it to him (and the class) how he saw it. So he told him, picture this:\n“A substantial man (tall, round about the countenance, swollen gut) in Washington Square reaches into a trash can. He considers it (the bagel), and walks on to the next. He does the exact same thing, except this time it’s a bacon, egg and cheese. He’s doing a circle around the fountain, like clock work, and by the time he comes around again he has an adequate stash. He takes his grocery cart to a nearby bench (of all the empty benches down wind of the public restrooms, it’s the one next to mine). He sits for a second. Then, he spots another trash can farther afield (untouched) and walks away. He walks back. He sits again and dips his hand down into his pocket. He chucks the poppyseed with cream cheese to a family of field sparrows. The field sparrows are pecking, and the piece of lightly toasted bread is shooting up and doing flips, ultimately migrating across the concrete to the place just beyond my feet. All of a sudden, a pigeon swoops in and starts pecking. Some of the swallows are scared away, but a few determined ones remain.”\nMax stopped talking, and looked out at the rows of his concerned classmates. Maddie, his crush, was looking right at him with reluctant judgement in her eyes as Sara leaned across the aisle and whispered something into her ear. He couldn’t hear what Sara was saying, but he could tell what Maddie was thinking.\n“What I’m trying to say is, is this was a homeless man who didn’t have anything to eat so he turned to digging through the throwaways, but still somehow he was overweight, maybe unhappy, and he threw what he did find to the birds first. Any way, I’m watching these birds fight for their right to feed, and I’m there thinking these aren’t sparrows. These are wolves in sheep’s clothing. Call it survival. This is a city of seagulls. Okay, that’s all. Thank you.”\n“Thank you,” He said to Max. “Does anyone have Questions?”\nSara’s hand shot straight up.\n“Yes, Sara.”\n“I don’t think this homeless man is altruistic. I mean, are birds supposed to eat human food? I don’t think it’s good for them, and now they have this dependence on this homeless man who may be an unreliable food source in the future.”\n“Thank you, Sara. Max, would you like to respond?”\nMax looked at Sara, and then at Maddie.\n“Stare at a painting long enough and it doesn’t look all that impressive. Some of the lines are messy and less precise than we would’ve liked. I guess, my answer is that…sometimes, we can overcomplicate niceness or look for the ill will of good intentions.”\n“Thanks, Max,” he said. “Sara, does that answer your question?”\n“Not really, Mr. P.”"
