    "text": "I saw him in the street that day in early June, hand on her shoulder, with her arm around his waist.\nWait, I remember. She was wearing a wide brim, and the hat was like her ankle-cut linen pants: white. It was the kind of white that no working woman or man would, or could, ever wear. She was one of those mothers who waded through the mornings and somehow stumbled upon afternoon, waiting for the time to turn to two. She’d pack a snack and make her way to the elementary school pick-up zone, where the first car in line belonged to the other Jennifer in front of her. Her name was Laura Chase and she was the same as the other mothers there, with hours to kill and always complaining, claiming to be busy and not like the one who was hard-working and had no taste to her. In her free time, Laura liked to talk about the rounded notes of red wine and sit on the back porch of her million and four dollar house, where the nearby pool was heated and salt water. Years later, when no one was home to swim in it, she’d invite her boyfriend over for a quick dip, in and out, or her son’s friends from high school who were going to the local college a few towns over."

    "text": "“Hey,” Levi said to him a second time.\nOwen was reading Catcher in The Rye on the bus, and he was getting to the good part so it took him a second to understand that someone was talking to him and not their mother on the phone insisting on the play by play of the school day before the game.\nIt was Levi, one of the other freshmen on the team, leaned back in the bench seat next to him, across the aisle, with his cleats off and feet dangling. His socks hadn’t been washed for a few games and he was a shorter fellow, second string. Coach had been substituting him in, late in the second halves.\nLevi wouldn’t play much, but he’d put his best foot forward when he was out there, kicking rocks, and he’d have a way of always seeing the silver lining in any sort of messed up situation.\n“Hey,” Owen said back, as he turned to face him. “Levi, right?”\n“Holden’s kind of a dick.”\n“Really?”\n“Don’t you think?”\n“I don’t know,” he said, still wondering if he’d guessed his name correctly. It’d only been two weeks since the start of the season. “I mean, I think, for me, it’s too early to tell.”\n“Huh, how far are you?”\n“Huh?”\n“In the book,” he said. “What’s happening right now in the book?”\n“Oh, right,” he said. “I’m at the part where he’s in a cab.”\n“Which cab?”\n“There’s more than one?”\n“The first or the second?\nOwen took his thumb out from between the pages and turned the book, now closed cover to cover, so Levi could see where the book mark was. Levi saw the width of the pages towards the back cover, thicker than he had previously thought. He nodded his head in the affirmative and then shook it left to right as he let out a disappointed sigh.\n“There’s not more than ten,” Levi said. “But there is more than one.”\n“I’ve got that to look forward to.”\n“You don’t like it so far?”\n“No, I mean, I like it.”\n“It’s a classic, but I know what you mean.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Well, we should talk about it when you finish.”\n“Yeah,” Owen said. “Okay.”\n“We could start a book club.”\n“That’d be cool.”\n“For sure,” Owen said as Levi turned back around and readjusted only to pull his foot to his face. Owen threw up in his mouth a little bit at the sight of it, but Levi thought the sock smelled all right.\nThe school bus was making its way over rolling hills, back through West Marin, and Owen was well past the part about Holden debating the pimp, by the time he checked his phone. One missed call, and Samantha had sent him a text.\n“Have a great game my forward,” she said. “Go score some goals, I love you.”\nEven though her less than sign next to the number three formed a heart, he sent a colon with a closing parenthesis and called back.\n“It was good,” he said to her. “I scored two goals!”\n“Congratulations, honey!”\n“Thanks, Mom.”\n“So,” Laura said. “What was the final score?”\n“Two to one, us, them.”"

    "text": "June was half done, and the baby was about to leave the nest.\n“I can’t,” Don had said to her before she too leaned in for a kiss, after their game of Twister back in May (that following Saturday). They were beside the hearth (no fire), bent over backwards in his living room, shoes off, one manicured hand on yellow. Another, on green. Laura had her socks on blue, and was flexing her high arch against the mat as Don spun the arrow. He was all on red, still somewhat guarded (same as her), and the tip landed on green.\n“Ah!” Laura said excitedly as he lifted his left leg up and over her lower back and reached for the far circle. It was too far, and he lost his balance. On the come-down, Don wrapped his arms around Laura and rolled onto his side to protect her from all the weight. He was 6’2 and 180 pounds. She was 5’5 and 125, perfectly fine, and crying happy tears.\n“I like your laugh,” he said to her as she rubbed her eyes red.\nDon was on his left side, facing her, and she was on her back, staring up at the ceiling.\n“It’s kind of awful,” she said. “Where hyena meets Santa Claus.”\nHe smiled and let out a small, sweet ahah, still looking at her.\n“Why do you do that?”\n“Do what?”\nHe followed her eyes as she turned over on her right side to look at his sky blue.\n“Put yourself down like that.”\n“Compliments make me uncomfortable.”\n“You’re not comfortable?”\n“No,” she said. “I am.”\nThere was a beat of silence, and then Laura sat up. Don felt the moment fall away from him, and he pressed his palms against the rug (Persian, floral) to sit up too.\n“Is everything okay?”\n“Yeah,” she said. “It’s just…”\n“What?”\n“I should go.”\nIt was still early in the night, not even after eight, and they hadn’t even gotten to the part where they took a walk around the neighborhood.\n“Are you sure?”\n“I’ve got an early morning tomorrow.”\n“Right,” Don said. “Vinyasa with…?”\n“Kundalini,” she said. “With Stan.”\n“I still can’t believe Stan is your yoga teacher.”\n“What do you have against Stan?”\n“No, nothing.”\n“Okay.”\n“He’s the one with the coy fish on his arm, right?”\n“What?”\n“The one with the tattoos?”\n“Yes, he has tattoos, and?”\n“Nothing, just checking.”\n“You’re being weird,” she said.\nDon brushed it off and took one corner of the Twister mat as Laura took another at the other end. They folded it once, so that green met red, and met in the middle. They stood there, facing each other, holding up the mat, knuckles touching knuckles. Only the thin plastic mat separated them, and the game was over. Don leaned in and kissed her. She kissed him back. Then, he pulled away.\n“I can’t….” he said. “We shouldn’t.”\nLaura didn’t say anything at first.\n“I’m so…stupid,” she said.\n“No, you’re not—my mistake.”\n“I should—go.”\n“You don’t have to,” he said.\n“I think I do…have to.”\nLaura plucked her empty wine glass (his tea mug) from the coffee table and walked straight past him to the kitchen sink, where she filled the lipstick-stained glass with tap water and tilted her brain back, twice. She reached for the soap and sponge and started at the rim as Don stood still in the living room, thoughtless, pretty paralyzed. He had felt something, which scared him.\nBy the time Don returned to himself, Laura’s sandals were no longer next to his boots in the breezeway. Halfway home, she had walked the dead end back to Main Street and jaywalked across two lanes of traffic going in opposite directions. She reached the bike trail, alive with feeling, hurt but happy it happened. Bay laurel beckoned, and eucalyptus spread its seed, but the mother owl was long gone as the newborn (Great Horned) nested, abandoned. The weeds were everywhere. The soil on either side of the new pavement was piecemeal picked apart. The blackberries weren’t yet ready, but the bird-box library was aplenty, whispering sweet nothings.\nTake one, leave one, it said to her (and every passerby). Live, and let be."

    "text": "Sundays were for popovers, a family recipe passed down from Nana and Papa on Owen’s mother’s side.\nLaura would creep downstairs in the early morning, as a force of habit. She’d go first into the kitchen and then carry an ice cube into the bathroom. She’d stand in front of the mirror, look at the fine lines and carve the freezing feeling like a slab across her face, from her lower cheekbone to her forehead. She’d close her eyes, and bring it over her lids, but the beep-beep-beeping would bring her back to earth. Soon enough, every time. She’d brace the edge of the sink, bow her head and inhale deeply before slamming the freezer shut. She was out of body, sometimes. No matter how many times she tried for closure, she’d always fail to close the door completely, and it would start again.\nBeep, beep, beep.\nWith a beet-red face, she’d take out the eggs and the milk, pasture-raised, and place them on the counter, next to the butter and flour from Saturday. It was gold Calacatta marble, imported from Italy (Carrara), and she’d made a mornay sauce with Don the night before. The pasta was fusilli, the twisty kind. There he was at her front door, dorky-looking, his veins protruding from strong arms that had hugged her goodbye.\n“Come over,” he had said. “I’ll cook for you next time.”\n“I’d love that,” she said back, leaning against the frame. “Saturday?”\n“Saturday.”\nHe had said it with a smile as he started to walk backwards (a few lingering glances) towards the cul-de-sac, and everything was calculated in the mind of Laura. She’d use about eight tablespoons for the mashed potatoes, emulsified for texture, and cut a slab for the table, leaving about six tablespoons, just enough to double the recipe and bring a few to Edith who was 92 years old and had no next of kin next door. Laura didn’t like to be left alone and Owen tended to spend Saturday nights with friends or Samantha, so she’d call up Levi’s father.\n“Hi, Don.”\n“Laura…”\n“So,” she’d say. “I have a whole bunch of heirloom potatoes that I just picked up from the farm stand, and…I was thinking…the boys are going to that party tonight…so…would you like to come over for dinner?”\n“I don’t know, I was just going to have a late lunch.”\n“Can’t start skipping dinner, now Don.”\nHe didn’t want to say yes, but he couldn’t say no.\n“Dinner sounds good.”\n“How’s seven, or six?”\n“Six works,” he said.\n“How about this,” she said. “We’ll make it together to buy you some time, build up an appetite, and we’ll eat later.”\n“Laura, you know I’m a bull in a china shop when it comes to the kitchen.”\n“I can show you how to use a cutting board.”\n“What can I bring?”\n“Nothing,” she said. “You can bring yourself.”\nLaura was flirting with him, and Don knew it."

    "text": "Laura and Owen and Levi and Don loaded into a car together and drove up north each summer for camping, as a family.\nThey weren’t family, but they were as close to it as Grandpa C. was suave in his Capper & Capper suit. He’d wear it, ivory and tweed, every other day-before-Christmas Eve, even though Laura called it her “Winter Solstice” party. Laura would throw a big party each year during the holidays and invite all of Owen’s friends and their families. There’d be charcuterie boards but in weird places, which always seemed to coincide with some home improvement that finally completed the house and that Laura was very excited to tell people about, so finding the food was somewhat of a hunt and always a source of gossip on drives home. For instance, one year, Laura put a charcuterie board out on the back deck despite the bitter cold weather they were having, as a way of leading guests to the new landscaping. It was all native species, and drought resistant.\n“I just want to do my part,” she said. “In times like these.”\nThis year, she put the charcuterie board upstairs in the old guest room that she’d recently converted into an art studio. She paid someone to do it, but it took months beyond the original quote and the whole thing was a nightmare. By the time winter solstice passed and the party came around, the room consisted of blank canvases despite a bunch of brushes that’d clearly been used. The paint was dry, still coating the bristles.\n“I just love it,” she said to the Townsend family who stood at the doorway, careful not to enter. “It’s a dream, you know…my very own easel.”\nLaura walked further into the recesses of the room and glided her palm across the stool, making her way towards the window.\n“Sitting on this seat, watching the sun rise.”\nThere was one painting: a four by four of the color green, centimeters thick and projecting from the canvas, with a single patch of blue left of center. She titled it, “Pubbenivasanussati,” which she translated for the Townsends as “the remembrance of former births.”\nThe death of his wife is what changed the holidays for him. Grandpa C. would pack into his little Volvo and drive the eight hours or so straight from Brentwood, CA, the last nice part of Los Angeles, or the City of no more Angels, as he’d refer to Home in his old age. He’d stay for as long as it took him to re-connect with his grandson, regain feeling in his legs, or finish off the Humboldt Fog. He swore by it—cheese on a cracker, eating standing, walking as a lifestyle, and saw driving the scenic route as the only exception for sitting idle."

    "text": "Dear —,\nIt’s 7:44 pm on Friday, May 30, 2025, which means I just missed my train, and the next F to Downtown & Brooklyn is in 13 minutes. Is it possible just to be, the luckiest unlucky person, or not to be? Now I see a perfectly clean seat to sit on, and have the opportunity to write whilst I wait. It’s my first time sitting on a subway platform bench, in all the (seven) years I’ve lived in this inspiring, (only slightly) dirty city, and the F train is rocking into the 57th Street station as I think of all the years we’ve called each other friends. Part of me wonders how in the world thirteen minutes have passed, and I’ve only managed to pen this much on the back of a postcard. I feel like the woman in the painting, who reminded me of you, deep in thought, with books on the table in front of her, I’m sure, a writing utensil in her right hand, and an infinite number of ideas in her head. She’s very fashionably dressed. Her green scarf reminds me of the denim skirt you wore, and polka-dotted long-sleeve henley, when we met up at the MET earlier this spring. This book I hope will offer you something along your creative path. I look forward to reading what you write, and one day seeing your name on a book cover, in the store of some independent bookseller on the lower east side of Manhattan, like Sweet Pickle Books, or McNally Jackson on Fulton. Rooting for you, and in your corner—always. Happy birthday, and summer solstice.\nLove,\nElizabeth Rose Aurora Bee Rain Kolling"

    "text": "Dear —,\nI have my traditions—rites of reflection. I walk Division Street each Sunday and turn left on Orchard, with the same destination in mind: Son Del North. The one and only burrito worth condsidering in New York City. I get the carne asada (caramelized onions, pinto beans, cheese, a grilled tortilla, comes with salsa verde).\nOn a sunny day, I’d have taken my bliss to Elizabeth Street Garden for eating followed by reading. However, today was drizzly and I didn’t end up getting a burrito. Here’s why: From Stanton Street, I could see a crowd out front, blocking the sidewalk and pouring out into the middle of the street. I walked up to a woman who had a burrito in her hand with some bites missing and asked what the situation was.\n“How long for a burrito, and why so many people?”\nIt took a few attempts to hear her, but she told me that today was the Pedro Pascal lookalike contest.\n“You know, the actor.”\n“Oh, okay, thanks,” I said, not sure what that had to do with Son Del North or what it meant for my burrito prospects. I weaved further into the compact crowd, without seeing much resemblance, and approached a man in a white uniform. My guess was that he worked for Son Del North, which has a white facade, but another man got to him first. He asked the question that I would’ve asked:\n“How do I order a burrito?”\nThe man in white looked down at the sidewalk to think for a second.\n“Uh, we’ll be open in 20 minutes.”\nI was confused; How could the kitchen be closed with all these people around eating burritos. They had to have ordered them, some way, somehow, which meant the place had to have been open and operating. Was it all of a sudden closed for some reason? I didn’t want to ask questions or get to the bottom of it. As people, we must pick our battles and so I walked on. I did look back though, before I reached E Houston Street. I saw that the man who had interjected was walking in the same direction. Both of us, at a (temporary) loss. No burrito today, but that’s okay. I had some delicuous Borscht, and potato and cheese dumplings, in Ukrainian Village.\nAfterwards, I planned to take the yellow line home. However, there was caution tape tied to the entrance and the posted sign said the R/W trains weren’t servicing the 8th St-NYU station, same as the past few weekends. So, I walked on towards West 4th (along Greenwich Avenue), which is where a full circle moment came into play.\nAs I walked, I sent a text inquiring about dinner. I offered to pick up some slices from Mama’s Too (which specializes in the square, but is my favorite for its triangular slice with pepperoni, vodka sauce, parmesan and basil (I believe)). Point is, this was a time-sensitive text. I was almsot at 6th Ave, after all, and I could either (1) go straight to the nearby subway or (2) presume every person wants pizza for dinner and go straight for the slices. I don’t like to presume, so I started to slow my roll. I walked at a snail’s pace, stopping a few times to loiter in front of quiet residences. I stopped outside Goods for the Study and looked into the store through the window. I saw the pens and the notebooks they sold, which looked nice. I thought maybe I could go in and buy some more time without actually buying anything while I waited for this special person to respond to my text.\nThen, all of a sudden, relief. A ding. Pizza, as it were. I started to respond at the spot, and I turned left to face the street (for some reason). That’s when I saw the face of a man who I recognized. This man looked too familiar for me not to stop him with a hey.\n“Hi,” he said.\n“I think we were…” I said.\n“I’m really in a rush,” he said.\n“Can I walk with you?”\nHe didn’t say yes but he didn’t say no. He sort of just shrugged, as if to say okay that should be fine.\nSo, I walked with him and tried to talk to him as if he were just a person (which I am convinced of, of course).\n“A few years ago, I was on a plane ride to San Francisco with you,” I said.\n“Woah, really? I haven’t been there in years. When was that?”\n“2018? 2019? 2021? I have no clue,” I said.\n“Huh.”\n“We were on the same plane ride, and I regretted not slipping you a piece of paper with my friend’s name on it. She’s a singer-songwriter, and I wanted to give her a plug.”\nAt this point, we were both stopped just before 6th Avenue, and he had turned to face me.\n“On Spotify? What’s her name?”\n“Yeah, Spotify,” I said as he pulled out his phone. “Rebecca McCartney.”\nHe typed in her name, tapped on her top song, Close to Me, and it played as he held out his phone.\n“Her?”\n“Yes, her.”\n“What songs?”\nI recommended my favorites as he scrolled through her discography.\n“They’re all good, give her a listen,” I said, and we parted ways.\nThe man on the street was Jack Antonoff, and I’ve been thinking about this interaction for the past few hours since it happened. The Universe kind of, sort of, gives you little gifts like these. For years since it happened, I’ve thought back on the flight to SFO when I saw him sitting in first class and recognized him then only to fail in telling him about my friend. I felt like I had failed her or lost her a career opportunity. I want for her to succeed like he has in the music industry, and I gave myself a hard time for not having the courage then to slip him a piece of paper with a note. And then today, years later, at about 5:11 pm (phone call to Rebecca time stamp), becuase of timing and a semi-broken subway system, I crossed paths with this music producer again. I was able to tell him about her, as I had originally intended. That feels good.\nIt’s also a wonder what leaves your mind when you meet a person who has been so successful at the thing that you or someone you know aspires to. The mystique takes over. For me, the word flight fell away from my vocabulary, and I ended up saying plane ride at least twice during the conversation. I thought that was funny.\nLove,\nElizabeth Rose Aurora Bee Rain Kolling"

    "text": "Dear —,\nAt the liqour store on Nostrand Ave, an old woman sits, asleep, in a beach chair, behind the bullet-proof glass. The store is mostly an open floor for customers, and it’s a narrow aisle bordered by shelves that are chock-full of bottles for the owner to reach for. I walk up to her, towards the end of the long runway. There’s a sign that warns about being 21. I’m 25, under-accomplished, and my excuse me rustles her awake. I say, “How much for the Josh?”\n“18.”\nShe sees it on my face, the sure reluctance of a working woman spending what could be savings.\n“15 for this one,” she insists, holding up one of the Projects.\n“And the Bacchus?”\n“13.”\nI ask for both, and carry the paper bags a block and a bit.\nTwo and a half hours later, it’s 10:24 pm. There’s an A train in 8 minutes from the Nostrand Ave station, and I just left my first writer’s group. I said the experience of reading the young woman’s writing was like standing in front of the stovetop, searing something in a cast iron pan. The steam, rising. I stand on the platform, in front of the Fire Department Standpipe Outlet as the rat’s tail threads the third rail.\nToday an acquaintance asked me if I had a black eye. No, I said. It was just my face, the blood in my veins, blue beneath the surface. A thin man is bent over, reaching into a backpack. He’s wearing purple pants made of a shiny fabric with a matching jacket and has a bottle of vodka. Either that, or water.\nThe young woman asked if anyone had ever seen La Ciénaga. I couldn’t remember the name of the fillmmaker, but I remember thinking she was like Alfonso Cuaron, except a woman, without the commercial viability. I mean, success. I Googled her later. Apparently the ex-CEO of Google just purchased a 24 million dollar home in San Francisco, and her name is Lucrecia Martel. Sometimes we consume what we don’t crave. I’ve been staring at the screen for at least eleven hours today.\nLove,\nElizabeth Rose Aurora Bee Rain Kolling"

Impression, Sunrise and the painter here alone, not lonely, dumb-founded and lost fishing, for some reason, looking, just looking at oil on canvas as though the square were a Rubik’s Cube, cubism, or something, his eyes wide, open to long game, looking a little bit longer, one-night stands and short-term relationships until then, standing too close for comfort, causing the security guard, already on edge, a great deal of discomfort in Gallery 819, which, 8 + 1 + 9, is a nine, her life path number, rolling shoulders, cracking knuckles, rocking heel to toe like the letter H, the humble sail, that one boat over green water, his nose now in it, sniffing, snorting, as high as the horizon line at 10 in the morning on a Sunday, after Saturday night had fallen aside like hail, hard, for him, and leaving, leaves of absence (easier), with these impressions of her own, this farsighted vision, tortoise to correct and frame amber lenses, a dream and no one buying, without the same talent or softening effect, that 19th Century attention span and perceived value system, those long lost cataracts, lying, stealing, cheating, looking, just sussing out the subway car, grasping at railing, rail thin, reeling, forever off the actress who had thought the last name of what’s his name, Édouard, who came before Him, sounded the exact same as where she had come from, the thing that didn’t grow on trees, money, which He had never much cared for, growing respectfully distant and disenchanted, on to the next, now more than ever set on and in pursuit of the reader who was so hard to get. Max didn’t get her, reading her text.\n“Hey so sorry to cancel, but I can’t actually make it to the MET tomorrow.”"

    "text": "May 30, 2025\nDear —,\nIt’s 7:44 pm on Friday, May 30, 2025, which means I just missed my train, and the next F to Downtown & Brooklyn is in 13 minutes. Is it possible just to be, the luckiest unlucky person, or not to be? Now I see a perfectly clean seat to sit on, and have the opportunity to write whilst I wait. It’s my first time sitting on a subway platform bench, in all the (seven) years I’ve lived in this inspiring, (only slightly) dirty city, and the F train is rocking into the 57th Street station as I think of all the years we’ve called each other friends. Part of me wonders how in the world thirteen minutes have passed, and I’ve only managed to pen this much on the back of a postcard. I feel like the woman in the painting, who reminded me of you, deep in thought, with books on the table in front of her, I’m sure, a writing utensil in her right hand, and an infinite number of ideas in her head. She’s very fashionably dressed. Her green scarf reminds me of the denim skirt you wore, and polka-dotted long-sleeve henley, when we met up at the MET earlier this spring. This book I hope will offer you something along your creative path. I look forward to reading what you write, and one day seeing your name on a book cover, in the store of some independent bookseller on the lower east side of Manhattan, like Sweet Pickle Books, or McNally Jackson on Fulton. Rooting for you, and in your corner—always. Happy birthday, and summer solstice.\nLove,\nElizabeth Rose Aurora Bee Rain Kolling"

    "text": "Dear Dad,\nYesterday was Father’s Day, and I thought of you. So I thought I’d write you a letter of all that I remember.\nWhen I was really young, you’d take me on hikes on Sundays. I’d wear my superman sneakers and think the S shield was my life force. I’d pick up every possible walking stick and pretend I was an old man. You told me the difference between right and wrong, the madrone and manzanita, and for so long I couldn’t see it.\nWe were living just outside of town then and Muir Woods was our backyard, the three of us. At age five, I learned how to ride a bike because you taught me. I was scared at first of falling off, but you called me a natural and all of a sudden I was ready for two wheels. You told me not to worry, as long as I had my helmet on and eyes open, I’d be safe. I remember one day on our walk I told you my superpower was knowing exactly what mom needs but I wish it could be flying like the ducks in front of us. We were sitting on a bench by Phoenix Lake, sharing a bag of orange slices, and you said your superpower was protecting water. I remember being confused by that. I didn’t know what you meant by it.\nMom asked if I wanted to go on a walk to the lake with her yesterday, but I wanted to go alone so I said no and then snuck out later without telling her. I felt bad, but sometimes being around her is like a sad reminder, and I just want to talk to my father. I hate that I sometimes refer to you as father. I wish you had wanted to talk too, Dad. I wish I had asked you more questions, like why water, or knew what you were going through. But I understand, and I’m piecing it together even if I can’t remember or don’t know everything. I hope you’re proud of the young man I’m becoming. I miss you. Mom misses you. We both wish you were here.\nLove, Owen"

    "text": "Max grew up poor in New York City, but he was talented, a class standout, and he learned to survive for the sake of his future.\nHis family moved from Florida for a fresh start, and his father moved back after the divorce, so he didn’t really know his father on a personal level but his father loved him enough to stay in touch. They talked about the un-touchy things, once or twice a month. His mother cheated with his kindergarten teacher, as he pieced it together, which meant he and his sister had to share a room and he was ever skeptical of the education system. Their apartment was a two-bedroom, one bath, small and naturally dark. He preferred the lights off, because they were otherwise blinding (LEDs). The rent-controlled co-op building was pre-war, on the Upper West Side, and he had to get glasses in the second grade. At least, that’s what he told the kids in school one day after weeks of calling him names.\n“Near the Museum.”\nHe said this to one kid by the cubbies, and then started making his rounds each recess.\nThe natural history buffs would be all buggy-eyed, thinking it was so cool, ’cause the Museum of Natural History was all the rage at that age. He’d be relieved momentarily, knowing deep down he was a phony. They’d invite him to tag along after school for the walks home. He’d peel away from the group walking downtown around 81st and Columbus and walk slowly towards Central Park West until he was sure no one was watching him. Then, he’d walk back up—sixteen or so blocks and two avenues west until he reached Manhattan Valley.\nHe was ashamed of who he was—where he lived, where he came from. He felt the shame of association, which turned into deep dislike and then eventual indifference. He didn’t really like his father or his mother or his sister. His parents weren’t the smartest people, and his sister was a cry baby. He hated how quick she was to play victim and put herself at the center.\nHe hadn’t always felt this way, she’d eventually remind him (when he started acting really sour towards her). There were the first few times after the divorce, where he’d get out of bed to console his sister. He’d tap her shoulder, brush his thumb across her temple towards her part and then tuck her hair behind her ear. He’d shh shh shhhh her until the tears down her cheek were dry, and she’d fall asleep.\nHis friends were his family, and he found any good enough reason to belong elesewhere."

    "text": "Her son had a lot of friends from high school, to start, but he had a way of dwindling the circle down like it was a jolly rancher getting rotated about in the mouth of the girl with the long brown hair from freshman year. He was a nice guy, and the other girls liked him too, but he didn’t much mind them. He only had eyes for the one, and he was more intent on what he was reading. The guys on the soccer team called him grim or the reader or the grim reader, one after the other, on the way to games.\n“How’s it going, Grim?”\n“What’s the reader reading today?”\n“Watch out the grim reader’s right behind you,” Cole would say in the seat behind him on the bus.\nIt was just fun and games, a play on the grim reaper, because he always had this look on his face when he was staring down at a page, like he was depressed or something. It was a cool November in his soul, he’d say to the guys, all serious, just to freak them out, but they always knew he was messing around. The thing he hated about being on the soccer team was that it always took him away from the school day. He’d have to leave Western Philosophy early, and he always felt like he was missing the part where everything made sense. He liked Plato best, because Plato was a bit of a romantic despite what the Stoics said.\nSomething good did come of it, though. The one girl with the long brown hair who always sat in what seemed to be the farthest seat possible from him, turned around one day and volunteered to take notes and send them to him. She had this incredible handwriting, and her notes were extremely meticulous, not sporadic or like Pollock in front of a tawny canvas. They were complete, converging, and read like little short stories. She was definitely smarter than him, which is why he loved her. He’d had this crush on her for at least a month into the note-taking before he mustered the courage to ask her out. He asked her if she wanted to go get ice cream, and that was that. They both liked mint chip, and before his mother knew it: Owen, which means noble or well-born or son of destiny, had a girlfriend in high school.\nLaura hated that they were together. She hated the girlfriend and this was revealed first in small ways but then pretty obviously at a certain point in time, maybe halfway through junior year, so he knew it’d never amount to much. She was pretty and a free spirit, she showed him things, and sometimes didn’t wear shoes when she walked around which upset him and was the only other major tension. It was good for now, not forever, and he was fine either way. Senior year came and graduation day, walking across the stage, and he broke it off with Samantha a few weeks later before she left for college. She was going on a pre-orientation water rafting trip, and he was able to do that sort of thing—be present and apparently sincere, but critical of himself and others on the inside. He had his best kept secrets and he cared a lot about what others thought, especially his mother who had decided early on to hold a grudge, never let it go, and let it fester like her toenail fungus, which she painted with prescription Ciclopirox every morning after yoga.\n“I want you to experience everything in its fullness,” he had said to her. “Not in distance.”\nEven in the bitter end she believed he was sweet, and maybe she looked just too good in flip flops."
