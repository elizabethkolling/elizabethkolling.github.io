<p>Dear —,</p>
<p>Saturday, Sunday, Monday, my dad tells me what his father told him: this too shall pass.</p>
<p>I won’t get over it.</p>
<p>One day, maybe, I’ll write about it.</p>
<p>Those lingering lines are intracranial and scenes from Titanic flash before me, as the water rushes in.</p>
<p>The four of us are there, taking cover under the gazebo.</p>
<p>Thank God it’s not a pergola.</p>
<p>We can’t see dry ground.</p>
<p>It rains hard, soft, and harder for longer.</p>
<p>But before this, I wake up.</p>
<p>I awaken at eight or so, which is late for an early birdie like me. By nature, I am a night owl.</p>
<p>I toss. I turn. I feel stranger than when I went to sleep.</p>
<p>I make eggs on toast with toasted fennel pork sausage, for breakfast.</p>
<p>I drink a liter of water, because I’m thirsty.</p>
<p>I rub in the sunscreen until it’s on like pale skin, after nine, 75 degrees, and 76% humidity outside.</p>
<p>I am wearing these low-set baggy jeans and a maroon long-sleeve.</p>
<p>I see the fabric darken, feel the wetness down my back. Already, I sweat.</p>
<p>I have got to move through it, that heat and high water.</p>
<p>I take it standing all the way down, knees bent, rocking heel to toe.</p>
<p>My wrist is against the metal railing, and there’s a young woman sitting next to a young man.</p>
<p>She has on a crossbody bag.</p>
<p><em>Little Miss Sunshine</em> is her claim.</p>
<p>I think of Summer in New York at this time last year.</p>
<p>The weather can change like a rerouted train, hard-fast.</p>
<p>You don’t know when the rainstorm is going to stop.</p>
<p>I see his hand in hers.</p>
<p>Hear the music playing on an endless loop in my ears.</p>
<p>What is Life, George Harrison?</p>
<p>What is my life, if not mine, if not for you?</p>
<p>How can I use my lived experience and imagination to say something that’s bigger, more important, than me and spread empathy.</p>
<p>I feel small in this sea.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what I like about New York City.</p>
<p>I make it to Fulton, go waterward where the sun is strong at 10:01.</p>
<p>I take off my sunglasses inside and order a few hours here.</p>
<p>There’s the MFAer in his corner.</p>
<p>“Were you away?”</p>
<p>He asks, I answer.</p>
<p>The semester’s started. Book will be done by the end of the month.</p>
<p>I still haven’t read his short story. I tell him I’ll have time in December.</p>
<p>I’m rude.</p>
<p>He doesn’t like me as a person either.</p>
<p>The barista places a scented candle between us.</p>
<p>It’s soy, and it stinks.</p>
<p>I’ve got to get it out from under my abated breath, so I reach out.</p>
<p>I slide it across the surface as I walk around the counter, which is shaped like the Mandarin character for mountain.</p>
<p>“Will you be back from now on?”</p>
<p>I don’t know, probably.</p>
<p>He says something mean, and I make him laugh.</p>
<p>“I’ve been holding a grudge against you.”</p>
<p>Why me? What did I do?</p>
<p>“Uh, I had one extra ticket, and I invited you to the hottest literary event in the city and you left without saying goodbye.”</p>
<p>I tell him sorry, but he should have invited someone else. I’m Irish. I exit.</p>
<p>On my way out, I run into my old roommate at the bottom of the staircase.</p>
<p>She enthusiastically says my name and hugs me.</p>
<p>Her hair is shorter. Her spirit, lighter.</p>
<p>I am happy for her.</p>
<p>“It’s so nice to see you. So, where are you now?”</p>
<p>Upper East Side, I tell her, in so many words.</p>
<p>“Oh, I could never live there, it’s so sterile.”</p>
<p>I don’t know, I’m a stone’s throw from the museums, and so close to Central Park.</p>
<p>She lives in Chinatown with 15 people.</p>
<p>“I’ll send you the info about that writer’s group.”</p>
<p>We say goodbye and promise to make plans.</p>
<p>I decide to go upstairs to see about Fernando Pessoa.</p>
<p>The young man behind the counter has been meaning to read it.</p>
<p>He asks if I’d like a bag.</p>
<p>I don’t want it, but I do.</p>
<p>I pass by Chatham Square, and notice it for the first time after all this time.</p>
<p>I need to call Nana Pretty.</p>
<p>At 1:23, I walk Orchard street in search of answers.</p>
<p>A bean and cheese is waiting for me, hot and ready.</p>
<p>By the way, I’m off the carne.</p>
<p>I’ve <em>been</em> off the carne.</p>
<p>All it was, was meat and tortilla. Very few beans. After a while, very little ooey gooey.</p>
<p>I am overheated, so I sit on the bench inside to steal some AC.</p>
<p>I lean into where wall meets window.</p>
<p>Minutes later, the woman in white approaches.</p>
<p>“Elizabeth?”</p>
<p>Yes, I say, thank you.</p>
<p>She smiles.</p>
<p>I smile back.</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but each time I get my order I stick my nose in it to check that the salsa crema is there at the bottom of the bag.</p>
<p>Indeed it always is, they’ve never once failed me.</p>
<p>I do this for two reasons.</p>
<p>I have my own experience in food service, and the stakes are high.</p>
<p>Sometimes the sauces are forgotten.</p>
<p>Sometimes systems fail.</p>
<p>There it is, under the surface, always.</p>
<p>The system is as broken as the song I break.</p>
<p>I get addicted.</p>
<p>I reply.</p>
<p>I replay.</p>
<p>It’s neverending.</p>
<p>There’s never peace of mind.</p>
<p>I turn right on Stanton.</p>
<p>I pass my sister’s favorite pizza spot, and I think of—</p>
<p>The bar where they look and look away with occasional eye contact.</p>
<p>The outdoor stools are only starting to fill, and today it smells fishy (like fish) at Allen.</p>
<p>I make it to the Bowery, where construction workers guide traffic.</p>
<p>A Sudan blocks the intersection, then does a U-turn.</p>
<p>I reach the point where Prince intersects Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I jaywalk left after another car goes right on the green light.</p>
<p>I take my chances.</p>
<p>Everyone has the same idea on a sunny Saturday.</p>
<p>A woman sunbathes on a bath towel.</p>
<p>I scour, until I see one lone chair next to a woman on a bench.</p>
<p>I ask, are you using this.</p>
<p>She shakes her head, then nods.</p>
<p>I understand her without hearing the words.</p>
<p>I lift the chair with my one free hand.</p>
<p>I feel strong.</p>
<p>I carry the seat to a spot under the northern tree.</p>
<p>The man who reads on the other side of the trunk is perturbed by my (respectful distance) nearness.</p>
<p>Immediately he moves his chair some three odd paces.</p>
<p>Three men have red cokes on a green table in the garden.</p>
<p>The verde is good, spicier than I remember.</p>
<p>I see the sky about to rain.</p>
<p>Lyrics are again in my head.</p>
<p>Neil Young from the stereo.</p>
<p>I used to listen with my mom on early morning drives to the farmers’ market.</p>
<p>We like Ambulance Blues, and On the Beach.</p>
<p>“Though my problems are meaningless / that don’t make them go away.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere is doing something different.</p>
<p>I chew, swallow, the last bite and move my station to safety.</p>
<p>Under the gazebo, I get comfortable.</p>
<p>I’m ready, happy, to wait out the storm.</p>
<p>Three sisters take cover once it starts.</p>
<p>Hebba, Noor, and Leen are visiting from Houston and Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>I’ve never been.</p>
<p>I hear there’s a good food scene.</p>
<p>“What are you reading?”</p>
<p>A book my friend recommended, the Book of Disquiet.</p>
<p>It’s Hayfa’s favorite.</p>
<p>“No one writes like this anymore,” she wrote me.</p>
<p>This book will be my ruin (in a really good way), I write back.</p>
<p>I have just started reading, but I can tell.</p>
<p>He equates the word distance with decadence.</p>
<p>It’s raining hard now.</p>
<p>I see the erosion, the newly raked over wood chips going with the flow, eroding the volunteer work.</p>
<p>[insert more]</p>
<p>I ask if they’d like a photo, for the memories.</p>
<p>Leen says, oh no.</p>
<p>Hebba pulls out her phone and prepares the camera for me as Noor aims a selfie at the four of us.</p>
<p>The son of the man who started Elizabeth Street Garden (I’m pretty sure) walks over to our shelter.</p>
<p>He’s been walking to and fro, bearing down the hatches or something for some time, and is soaked.</p>
<p>Now, he is walking towards us.</p>
<p>“Hey,” he says. “We’re going to keep an eye on this rain, but if it continues for long, we may close early, so I just wanted to let you all know, the garden may be closing early today.”</p>
<p>We thank him, and he walks off on some other maintenance mission.</p>
<p>“Oh my God,” says Leen. “Who was that? WHo is that man? He is like the real-life Mr.&nbsp;Darcy in the rain.”</p>
<p>The other three of us laugh and nod in agreement since it was in fact pretty hot what had just happened.</p>
<p>If only he’d return with a really big umbrella, I say.</p>
<p>I have a computer and three books in my pack to protect.</p>
<p>I think of Pride and Prejudice, since it was mentioned. I have read the book, but I’ve only seen the Keira Knightley version. I’ll have to look up the name of the male actor, because I don’t know it. Matthew something.</p>
<p>When was Mr.&nbsp;Darcy in the rain, anyway?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I remember.</p>
<p>Leen must have been referring to the scene where he confesses his feelings, and she turns him down.</p>
<p>I like the last scene, obviously, because they end up together, and it makes me feel something.</p>
<p>I also like the opening shot of the field and the trees and the fog, becasue it’s beautiful and reminds me of where I grew up.</p>
<p>“Do you ever think you’ll return to California?”</p>
<p>I mean, California is home. I’ve always thought I’d live in San Francisco at some point, maybe Los Angeles or London. My close friend from college is from there, and for many years she’s told me I must come see about it.</p>
<p>She’s encouraging me to apply to an MFA there. I don’t think they have those over there. It’s called something different.</p>
<p>“An MFA in what?”</p>
<p>Creative writing, I tell her. I don’t know though, I’ve never been able to justify paying for one. If I want to be a writer, why can’t I just write in my free time and have a job that pays for my livelihood and maybe it amounts to something that’s finished one day. It’s proven to be slow. A slow process.</p>
<p>“I get that,” says Noor.</p>
<p>Noor is a very good editor is what Leen tells me.</p>
<p>“I asked her to edit my essay for an application, and I ended up getting the scholarship. She’s really amazing.”</p>
<p>I smile and tell them what I think, that that’s amazing. I ask Noor if she’d ever want to go into publishing.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” she says. “But I just don’t know how to.”</p>
<p>I tell her I relate to that. There are so many hidden paths forward. Hidden in plain sight are people everywhere who are doing. They are actors or published authors, and it feels very out of reach. I don’t know how to get my foot in the door anywhere. I was introduced to this girl whose dad is top executive at Creative Artists Agency. She went to the women’s college across the way from mine and majored in film. I would’ve majored in economics and creative writing and film, if I could. But any way, her dad got her a job in a Hollywood writer’s room after college.</p>
<p>“And then I realized,” she had said to me. “I just don’t like writing.”</p>
<p>She liked reading, so her dad got her a job in publishing. That’s life. All’s fair in love and war.</p>
<p>If you could for your children, then why wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>We try to build our own paradise, even if that means others miss the boarding.</p>
<p>My head’s in the sky.</p>
<p>I see no plane overhead.</p>
<p>“The industry’s changed a lot,” the daughter of this CAA executive had said to me in 2022. “With every book or movie, you need some celebrity attached to it or it’s not marketable.”</p>
<p>I believed her.</p>
<p>I sent her some of my writing.</p>
<p>She never read it.</p>
<p>Am I her, to the MFAer?</p>
<p>The rain does not subside. It is only raining harder.</p>
<p>I shift in and out of present and past tenses.</p>
<p>“We should have maybe tried leaving when we had the chance earlier,” said Hebba.</p>
<p>“We were too engrossed in conversation,” said Noor.</p>
<p>I know. I feel bad and say I’m sorry.</p>
<p>“No, don’t be, we really like talking to you.”</p>
<p>I like talking to them too, the three sisters who had just appeared.</p>
<p>“Before this, we were in Egypt for a wedding.”</p>
<p>I went to one in Santa Cruz recently. I would want a small wedding, whatever that means.</p>
<p>I guess, people get blinded by whatever this or that about the wedding and lose sight of the why.</p>
<p>I tell them I’ve always wanted to visit Egypt.</p>
<p>“Do you travel much?”</p>
<p>I think of what much means. I haven’t traveled as much as the people in my life, but I am fortunate enough.</p>
<p>I’m always waiting for sh*t to hit the fan, so I save.</p>
<p>I did just go to Italy in March, from the middle of March or so to April.</p>
<p>My sister was studying in Florence.</p>
<p>We went to the Uffizi and I got to see <em>Spring</em> in person.</p>
<p>We spent time in Malta too.</p>
<p>We’re Maltese and have always wanted to visit.</p>
<p>I met a woman at a cafe with the last name Vella.</p>
<p>She said it is as common as limestone, and likely we aren’t related.</p>
<p>We have other motherlands to return to some day too, like Wales and Ireland.</p>
<p>I was split between Ireland and Wales, when we were assigned a research in elementary school (Grade 3?). I ended up choosing Wales, because I really wanted a pet lamb (before I ever wanted a puppy), and I discovered that Wales has historically had more sheep than people. That sounded like the place to be.</p>
<p>To me, there was an opening.</p>
<p>So, I took it.</p>
<p>I said my goodbyes and stepped on the sand bag.</p>
<p>I won’t get over it, I told myself.</p>
<p>I’ve got to move through it.</p>
<p>I stuck my right shoe in the water and launched myself to the other side.</p>
<p>I hardly made a splash.</p>
<p>I waved with my hand trailing my body but didn’t look back.</p>
<p>Sometimes one goodbye is never enough when you want to say hello all over again.</p>
<p>[insert more]</p>
<p>It’s Sunday morning and raining outside, so I decide to take a walk.</p>
<p>I hear the soles of runners.</p>
<p>They squish against the hexagons of 5th Avenue, while the wheels of heavy loads slosh.</p>
<p>The road is one way, and otherwise safe.</p>
<p>I’m going in the wrong direction, turning left at 96th Street.</p>
<p>I follow the path towards Thorvaldsen, thinking there’s an outlet.</p>
<p>He holds a mallet and a chisel in his hand.</p>
<p>I walk back the path.</p>
<p>Up ahead, a man exits.</p>
<p>I enter.</p>
<p>I walk west across Central Park, with a red umbrella.</p>
<p>I see the pool and algae bloom.</p>
<p>The landscaped brown eyed susans are like the ones in the garden we planted with mom when we were younger.</p>
<p>I cross Amsterdam and 110 and look at the facade.</p>
<p>I am the reason for the line out the door, next to order.</p>
<p>A few hours, I say, for here, please.</p>
<p>I find a free table facing the street.</p>
<p>At 12:02, I turn with a light stretch towards the back.</p>
<p>There, I see Peter at the staff table.</p>
<p>Years (three and a half) have passed, and he’s still here folding boxes for his son on a Sunday.</p>
<p>I remember how he had picked a fig and brought it over with a proffered palm.</p>
<p>I reached out to receive it.</p>
<p>Where did this come from, I had asked.</p>
<p>“I picked it for you.”</p>
<p>(You picked me a fig, Peter?)</p>
<p>“Yes, from a secret tree.”</p>
<p>(Wow, I’m so touched, thank you. So, where is this secret tree you speak of?)</p>
<p>“Well, there are some secrets I must keep.”</p>
<p>(Of course.)</p>
<p>I bit into the green fig on September 10, 2022.</p>
<p>I have the picture for proof.</p>
<p>It was reddish-pink, white on the inside.</p>
<p>I write for an hour and sip the weak coffee.</p>
<p>I’m strong enough to sustain this, the lack of sleep, but the better half of me is crashing.</p>
<p>A man approaches.</p>
<p>I shake my head, then nod.</p>
<p>He understands without the words and motions his two daughters towards the open table.</p>
<p>Come closer.</p>
<p>The younger takes the empty chair sitting across from me.</p>
<p>“How do we order?”</p>
<p>At the counter, I tell them, and point to where the line ends.</p>
<p>Beyond the young woman with a Goodnight Moon tote tugging at her shoulder, I see him.</p>
<p>Outside, the man with the abundance of plastic bags spoons something out of a to-go box, into his mouth.</p>
<p>A homeless woman stirs impatiently in place and then walks out the door.</p>
<p>I sigh after the sip.</p>
<p>I text Zach that I’m in the old neighborhood.</p>
<p>I ask if he’s around.</p>
<p>He calls to tell me what he tells me.</p>
<p>He’ll be right there.</p>
<p>He doesn’t order anything.</p>
<p>The apps are going well for him, and he’s a bit overwhelmed with all the interest.</p>
<p>“I never want to settle.”</p>
<p>So, he plays the field.</p>
<p>He is looking for the woman he’ll marry.</p>
<p>I wish I knew someone who was perfect for him.</p>
<p>“I met wifey,” he says. “We went on a few dates, but she’s not ready for a relationship.”</p>
<p>She just got out of one.</p>
<p>She needs time, I tell him.</p>
<p>I don’t have much more of it.</p>
<p>I need to go soon.</p>
<p>I have some business to attend to at 2 pm, downtown.</p>
<p>But first I’m headed uptown for something, to do what should’ve been done a long time ago.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>I have a book in my hand that’s been way past due.</p>
<p>I plan to drop it in the box. But before this, we hug goodbye.</p>
<p>He tells me he’s headed the opposite way but that actually he needs to pee.</p>
<p>I wish him luck with the line on his second approach and turn towards Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.</p>
<p>Morningside Library is closed, so I do the drop and wonder.</p>
<p>Did the cover survive the fall?</p>
<p>Will they ever let me in again?</p>
<p>I myself need to pee all of a sudden, so I go back just for the restroom.</p>
<p>The line is three people long.</p>
<p>“How is the wait, long?”</p>
<p>It’s moving. I think we’re good.</p>
<p>“Sweet.”</p>
<p>I guess time passes differently for each person in line for the restroom.</p>
<p>The young woman looks at me like she’s a question mark.</p>
<p>*Croissant, plain or with butter and jam.</p>
<p>Danish, cinnamon, prune, cheese.</p>
<p>Apple turnover.</p>
<p>Almond crescent butterfly(, whatever that means).</p>
<p>Hamentash, poppyseed, prune, walnut.</p>
<p>Linzer tart, apricot raspberry</p>
<p>Bullseye, apricot, marzipan.</p>
<p>Almond horn.</p>
<p>Assorted small cookies by the lb. Or a plate of 4 (table service).</p>
<p>Lemon slice.</p>
<p>Cherry Slice.</p>
<p>Hazelnut slice.</p>
<p>Apple Linzer.*</p>
<p>“I told myself no coffee today,” she tells me. “I’m hungover, and I didn’t want to add to this melange.”</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So what’d you get instead, I ask her.</p>
<p>“The danish.”</p>
<p>(Ah, cheese?)</p>
<p>“Cherry.”</p>
<p>(I’ve heard great things about the cherry and cheese.)</p>
<p>“It’s very good.”</p>
<p>A beat of silence goes by, and she says she likes the painting on the wall.</p>
<p>I glance up at the one she’s not looking at.</p>
<p>They’re nice, I say, looking around the room.</p>
<p>I don’t think they’re all that nice.</p>
<p>(You know, I had never much paid attention to the art hanging on the walls in here, and then I did one day, and I was shocked to find this casual nude, just casually here.)</p>
<p>“Haha, where?”</p>
<p>There, I say, lifting my curled pointer finger.</p>
<p>“Oh, that is a casual nude, totally.”</p>
<p>(But this is a nice painting, you mean this one?)</p>
<p>“Haha, I actually meant the one to the left of it.”</p>
<p>(Oh, haha, well, that one’s also nice. Are you a big fan of the MET?)</p>
<p>“You know, I’m not really a big art buff, but I like the Moma.”</p>
<p>I think that’s fair.</p>
<p>I like the MOMA too, I say. (It took me a long time to find Starry Night. They had moved it to the second floor at one point, but it’s back up on the fifth, I believe.)</p>
<p>The sliding door opens.</p>
<p>I close it as I enter and pivot on my axis with an awkward <em>it was nice to meet you too!</em></p>
<p>I lock the hatch, and find that the restroom has another fresh coat of paint-over.</p>
<p>The freedom of speech must’ve been too offensive.</p>
<p>I read the wall as I sit on the toilet seat.</p>
<p>I’m not too proud a person to deny it.</p>
<p><em>Let the people speak!</em></p>
<p><em>Funny thing I only see people doing fucked up things.</em></p>
<p><em>New horrors daily. Hell is here.</em></p>
<p><em>God is love. Love is blind. Stevie Wonder is blind. Stevie Wonder is God.</em></p>
<p><em>Good things are coming for you.</em></p>
<p><em>Bring them home.</em></p>
<p><em>My pen died, lol.</em></p>
<p>I take the One to 42nd, and then the W to 23rd.</p>
<p>The first thing that Adri says to me is I broke the glass ring.</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Allegra looks at me, with an eye roll.</p>
<p>[insert more]</p>
<p>I don’t set alarms.</p>
<p>I feel that it’s time.</p>
<p>Monday, I wake up at 3, 4:30 in the morning, and fall back asleep until 8:07.</p>
<p>I am late to being early.</p>
<p>I make a smoothie on the fly and leave before the half hour.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Elizabeth Kolling</p>
